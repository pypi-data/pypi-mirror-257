    "In this demo, we show how the Oqtant Quantum Matter Service can be used to observe interference between many Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs)! The double slit experiment is one of the most famous physics experiments, and is taught in introductory quantum mechanics classes. If you are unfamiliar with this experiment - you can read about it [here](https://plus.maths.org/content/physics-minute-double-slit-experiment-0). The original double slit experiment demonstrates the wave-particle duality of matter. \n",
    "\n",
    "This demo is very similar to the double slit experiment, but uses many slits instead of just two. We form many slits by creating an array of optical potential barriers, also known as a diffraction grating. The barrier array is gently ramped on in time to form many different spatially separated BECs. After releasing these BECs from the trap, the BECs \"diffract\" and interfere with one another as they expand during [time-of-flight](https://oqtant-test.infleqtion.com/technical/imaging.md) (TOF). The diffraction patterns which form are a demonstration of the wavelike nature of the Bose-Einstein condensates created with Oqtant's Quantum Matter Service.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in learning more, you can check out the following paper: [Interference of an array of independent Bose-Einstein condensates](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0405113). This paper uses a very similar experiment to study what happens when the \"phases\" of the neighboring BECs are correlated versus when the phases are entirely random. "
