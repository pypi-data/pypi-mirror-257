    "One of the most striking features demonstrated by quantum matter is that of *interference*, a consequence of the wavelike and coherent nature of quantum systems.  Interference is the fundamental phenomena that enables the burgeoning field of quantum sensing.  Many of the world's most sensitive measurements of gravitational waves, accelerations, rotations, gravity, magnetic fields and time all leverage quantum interference and the interferometry techniques built upon it.  We can start exploring this vast and fascinating topic using Oqtant QMS. \n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate interference, we need to split the quantum matter into $\\geq 1$ distinct spatial regions, release the trapping potential so that the spatially-separated samples can expand and overlap, and detect the interference by taking an image.  With Barrier objects and time-of-flight imaging, we have all the tools necessary to accomplish this demonstration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For further reading, see e.g. the 1997 paper [Observation of Interference Between Two Bose Condensates](https://www.rle.mit.edu/cua_pub/ketterle_group/Projects_1997/Pubs_97/andr97-Science_int.pdf) which used an experimental setup very similar to the hardware accessible by Oqtant QMS. "

    "First, we will create a barrier that will be used to split our atom ensemble into two distinct spatial regions. The goal is to gently separate the cloud by slowly increasing the barrier height so that the quantum matter isn't heated or excited in the process. On the other hand, the process can't be too slow because the quantum matter clouds on either side of the barrier need to remain coherent. After splitting the cloud, the barrier and overall (magnetic) trapping potential is turned off to allow the clouds to recombine as they fall under gravity."
