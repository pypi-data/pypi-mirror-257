    "The next level of control of quantum matter is dynamically altering the potential energy as a function of position during the manipulation phase.  In Oqtant, this is accomplished by applying far-blue-detuned light fields to the atom ensemble.  This \"painted\" light represents a *repulsive* potential energy to the atoms via the AC Stark shift.  The spatially-dependent potential energy depends on the local intensity of the light field. Dynamic control of the local intensity alters the potential energy landscape in which the atoms are trapped. \n",
    "\n",
    "OqtAPI users have control of this light field by creating and manipulating one or more `Barrier` objects, which are superimposed on the background magnetic potential that traps the atoms.  Other abstracted optical objects are also supported and will be the topic of future walkthroughs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this walkthrough, we will explore application of quasi-1D optical barriers on Oqtant's cigar-shaped atomic ensembles.  Users have control over the dynamic position (in microns), width (in microns), energetic height (in kHz), and shape of the barrier objects painted along the long dimension of the ensemble.  The effective 1D potential is achieved by quickly rastering/scanning the applied light along one short axis, while the light propagates along the other short axis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Application of these barriers allows for the ensemble to be split, recombined, swept to one side, or any number of other desired manipulations.  Such manipulations are the building blocks for constructing atomtronic circuits, exploring interference and tunneling, studying quantum dynamics, or developing quantum sensors.    "

    "Furthermore, as seen above when inspecting the dyanmics of Barrier parameters, the properties of the projected light are updated periodically on a 100 microsecond period. All Barrier dynamics and dynamics of any painted light features exhibit discrete jumps as properties are periodically updated.  We saw this behavior above when inspecting the *dynamics* of Barrier object parameters.  \n",

    "Along the narrow axis of the quantum matter, the Gaussian spots are rastered quickly to achieve a quasi-1D potential energy.  Generally, it is wise to keep the update timescales fast compared to the dynamics of the atoms in the trap.  In the case of Oqtant, the magnetic trapping frequencies are approximately 40 Hz along the weak axis and 400 Hz along the strong axes.  The short update period of light features and fast (20 kHz) raster rate ensure, under most circumstances, that the atoms only experience the *average* of the applied light field.  "

    "The algorithms implemented in Oqtant's projection system are designed to minimize these potentially unwanted effects, though item (2) above is still present in the current system.  One consequence of the above is that the narrowest possible Barriers are created by specifying a SQUARE barrier of minimal width (currently 0.5 microns) with an integer position.  The resulting Barrier object will consist of only a single diffracted spot, and will in reality be gaussian rather than square, realizing the smallest possible feature projected by the Oqtant hardware."
