    "When the Oqtant hardware captures an in-trap image, the number of atoms detected is affected by the presence of the magnetic trap. Spatially varying magnetic fields (check out ```sim_matter.show_potential```) also complicate the calculation of atom number in hardware experimental in-trap images. For this reason, Oqtant in-trap images are not returned with an atom number. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, the simulator has perfect detection because every atom is accounted for. In order to produce simulator in-trap image outputs which are an approximate indicator of hardware performance, simulator in-trap images have been systematically corrected to match the offset in atom number observed in experiment. The result is an in-trap image with a hardware-like peak OD, which displays fewer atoms. If you wish to calculate atom currents or total atoms in any specific region, please use the un-corrected outputs in ```sim_matter.sim.get_column_densities```.
