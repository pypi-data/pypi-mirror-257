# typed-ffmpeg

https://livingbio.github.io/typed-ffmpeg/

This repository serves as an experimental project in which I employ GPT to create a functional SDK for ffmpeg.

I selected this research endeavor due to the recognition that it remains a challenging task for artificial intelligence, though it is indeed achievable.

The challenges are categorized as follows:

- Leveraging AI for code completion (Copilot).
- Enabling AI to autonomously handle repetitive and mundane tasks (current focus).
- Tasking AI with problem-solving capabilities.


# Records:
Each times, I will explore various approaches and document the outcomes in this repository.
