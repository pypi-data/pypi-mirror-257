class RestrictiveUnpickler(StreamUnpickler):
    
    """
    This subclass of unpickler can only load object that have already been allowed.

    The permission system lets you allow:
     - single objects based on identity (using id, useful for function such as exec, print, etc.) using 'allow_object(obj)'.
     - classes and their direct instances using 'allow_class(cls)'.
     - class trees and their instances using 'allow_class_hierarchy(cls)'.
    
    You can also forbid classes directly or class trees and parts of a class tree can be allowed while others are forbidden.
    For example, given the following class structure:
    ```
    A
    └───B
        ├───C
        └───D
            └───E
                └───F
                    └───G
    ```
    The following script:
    >>> unp = RestrictiveUnpickler()
    >>> unp.allow_class_hierarchy(A)
    >>> unp.forbid_class_hierarchy(D)
    >>> unp.allow_class_hierarchy(F)

    would allow the classes A, B, C, F, G and all of their direct instances. (With each consecutive line the sets of allowed classes are : {}, {A, B, C, D, E, F, G}, {A, B, C}, {A, B, C, F, G}.)

    You can also forbid a class and allow their hierarchy.
    For example, with the previous class structure:
    >>> unp = RestrictiveUnpickler()
    >>> unp.allow_class_hierarchy(A)
    >>> unp.forbid_class(A)

    would allow all direct or indirect subclasses of A (and their instances) but not A itself (nor its instances).

    Note that when a class inherits from multiple bases, and is not allowed itself, all of its bases must be allowed (directly or not).
    Also note that you cannot forbid certain builtins classes, such as bytes, str, int, etc. They will be allowed by default but not their successors.
