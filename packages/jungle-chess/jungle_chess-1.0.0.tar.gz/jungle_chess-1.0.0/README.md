## Overview

**Jungle Chess** (aka **Dou Shou Qi**) is a modern Chinese strategy board game for two players.

The Jungle gameboard represents a jungle terrain with *dens*, *traps* "set" around dens, and *rivers*. Each player controls eight game pieces representing different animals of various rank. Stronger-ranked animals can capture ("eat") animals of weaker or equal rank. The player who is first to maneuver any one of their pieces into the opponent's den wins the game. An alternative way to win is to capture all the opponent's pieces.

Please review the rules and detailed description of the Dou Shou Qi on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle_(board_game)).
