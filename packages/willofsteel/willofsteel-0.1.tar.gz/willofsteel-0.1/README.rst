       # Querying the api for the api key holder's profile
       player = client.get_player()
       
       # Creating a file name to log the results with
       timestamp = time.asctime().replace(':', '_')

       # Logging results
       with open(f'{timestamp}.txt', 'x', encoding='utf-8') as f:
           f.write(player)
       
       print(f"Query made at {timestamp}")

   while True:
       scheduled_query()
       time.sleep(3600)
