# Àkàndé

![Banner for Àkàndé - Voice Assistant][banner]

Àkàndé is an advanced voice assistant built in Python, leveraging OpenAI's GPT models for natural language understanding and response generation. Àkàndé has been enhanced to include a caching mechanism for efficient response retrieval and the ability to generate PDF summaries of interactions, making it ideal for both personal assistance and executive briefing purposes.

![divider][divider]

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT models to understand and generate human-like responses.
- **PDF Summary Generation**: Generates PDF summaries of voice interactions, including a question header, AI-generated response, and an accompanying logo.
- **Caching Mechanism**: Implements a SQLite-based caching system to store and retrieve past queries and responses, reducing API calls and improving response times.
- **Voice Recognition**: Integrates with speech recognition libraries to support voice input.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts text responses into speech, providing an interactive voice-based user experience.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Pipenv or virtualenv
