# Repo On Fire

Google's [repo][1] tool - but on fire ðŸ”¥

## About

`repo-on-fire` aims to be a thin wrapper around Google's `repo` tool. `repo`
already does a decent job when it comes to managing larger projects consisting
of several `git` repositories. `repo-on-fire` (or - `rof`) doesn't re-invent
the wheel here - instead, it wraps around `repo`, adding
some useful functionality on top. Particularly, this means: `rof` aims
to be 100% command line compatible with `repo` - ideally, where ever you can
use `repo`, you can instead use `rof`, taking benefit of that certain _X_ it
adds.

## Features

Currently, on top of allowing you to call through to any of the `repo` commands,
`repo-on-fire` adds the following features on top:

- Automatic workspace caching.


## Installation

You can use the following to install `repo-on-fire`:

### PDM

The tool is managed using [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/latest/). Hence, install
it and then you can clone the sources of the tool and install all needed
dependencies in a virtual environment:
