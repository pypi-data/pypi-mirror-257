
Q1SS: Experimental development of Quantum 1-Shot Signatures
===========================================================

This library contains experiments in Quantum 1-Shot Signatures,
with particular focus on applications to blockchain technology.

Modules of interest:

- The :mod:`q1ss.binalg` module contains binary linear algebra primitives used
  by the remainder of the library.
- The :mod:`q1ss.ap` module contains implementations of affine partition functions.

Further modules are in development for the construction, optimisation and
obfuscation of binary circuits and quantum oracles, as well as quantum
resource estimation.
