Install
-------

The library is currently in pre-alpha development, but you can install the latest release from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/q1ss/>`_ as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install --upgrade q1ss

Low-level operations are vectorised using `numpy <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/>`_, which is a required dependency of this library.

If `numba <https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ is installed, it is automatically used to JIT-compile certain low-level operations for additional performance:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install --upgrade numba

If `cupy <https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/>`_ is installed additionally to `numba <https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_, GPU acceleration can be used for certain operations:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install --upgrade cupy
