#### finmodels

`finmodels` is a Python package designed for financial analysis and optimization. It includes a collection of financial models, such as Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation and Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization. With finmodels, you can perform essential financial calculations to support investment decisions and portfolio management.

#### Key Features
`Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation`: Calculate the present value of future cash flows to assess the intrinsic value of an investment.

`Portfolio Optimization`: Optimize portfolio allocations using Mean-Variance Optimization to balance returns and risk.

#### Installation

You can install the package using `pip`:

```
pip install finmodels
```
Usage
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation
```
import finmodels as fm
```
#### Example usage of DCF valuation
```
cash_flows = [100, 150, 200, 250]
discount_rate = 0.1
dcf_value = fm.calculate_dcf(cash_flows, discount_rate)
print("DCF Value:", dcf_value)
```
#### Portfolio Optimization

```
import finmodels as fm
import numpy as np

# Example usage of portfolio optimization
expected_returns = np.array([0.05, 0.08, 0.12])
covariance_matrix = np.array([[0.001, 0.0005, 0.0002],
                              [0.0005, 0.002, 0.001],
                              [0.0002, 0.001, 0.003]])
optimal_weights = fm.optimize_portfolio(expected_returns, covariance_matrix)
print("Optimal Portfolio Weights:", optimal_weights)
```
