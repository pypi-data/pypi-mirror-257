    Parameters
    ----------
    array : numpy.ndarray
        The array of values for calculating the standard deviation.
    **kwargs

    Notes
    -----
    The weighting uses an asymmetric coefficient (`k` in the asPLS paper) of 0.5 instead
    of the 2 listed in the asPLS paper. pybaselines uses the factor of 0.5 since it
    matches the results in Table 2 and Figure 5 of the asPLS paper closer than the
    factor of 2 and fits noisy data much better.

    Notes
    -----
    The reference is not clear as to how `p` and `1-p` are applied. An alternative could
    be that `partial_weights` are multiplied only where the residual is greater than
    0 and that all other weights are `1-p`, but based on Figure 1c in the reference, the
    total weights are never greater than `partial_weights`, so that must mean the non-peak
    regions have a weight of `1-p` times `partial_weights` rather than just `1-p`;
    both weighting systems give near identical results, so it is not a big deal.

def _quantile(y, fit, quantile, eps=None):
    r"""
    An approximation of quantile loss.

    The loss is defined as :math:`\rho(r) / |r|`, where r is the residual, `y - fit`,
    and the function :math:`\rho(r)` is `quantile` for `r` > 0 and 1 - `quantile`
    for `r` < 0. Rather than using `|r|` as the denominator, which is non-differentiable
    and causes issues when `r` = 0, the denominator is approximated as
    :math:`\sqrt{r^2 + eps}` where `eps` is a small number.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y : numpy.ndarray
        The values of the raw data.
    fit : numpy.ndarray
        The fit values.
    quantile : float
        The quantile value.
    eps : float, optional
        A small value added to the square of `residual` to prevent dividing by 0.
        Default is None, which uses `(1e-6 * max(abs(fit)))**2`.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        The calculated loss, which can be used as weighting when performing iteratively
        reweighted least squares (IRLS)
