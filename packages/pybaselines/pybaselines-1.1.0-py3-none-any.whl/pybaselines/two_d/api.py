    """
    A class for all 2D baseline correction algorithms.

    Contains all available 2D baseline correction algorithms in pybaselines as methods to
    allow a single interface for easier usage.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x_data : array-like, shape (M,), optional
        The x-values of the measured data. Default is None, which will create an
        array from -1 to 1 during the first function call with length equal to the
        input data length.
    z_data : array-like, shape (N,), optional
        The z-values of the measured data. Default is None, which will create an
        array from -1 to 1 during the first function call with length equal to the
        input data length.
    check_finite : bool, optional
        If True (default), will raise an error if any values in input data are not finite.
        Setting to False will skip the check. Note that errors may occur if
        `check_finite` is False and the input data contains non-finite values.
    output_dtype : type or numpy.dtype, optional
        The dtype to cast the output array. Default is None, which uses the typing
        of the input data.

    Attributes
    ----------
    poly_order : Sequence[int, int]
        The last polynomial order used for a polynomial algorithm. Initially is -1, denoting
        that no polynomial fitting has been performed.
    pspline : pybaselines.two_d._spline_utils.PSpline2D or None
        The PSpline object for setting up and solving penalized spline algorithms. Is None
        if no penalized spline setup has been performed.
    vandermonde : numpy.ndarray or None
        The Vandermonde matrix for solving polynomial equations. Is None if no polynomial
        setup has been performed.
    whittaker_system : pybaselines.two_d._banded_utils.PenalizedSystem2D or None
        The PenalizedSystem object for setting up and solving Whittaker-smoothing-based
        algorithms. Is None if no Whittaker setup has been performed.
    x : numpy.ndarray or None
        The x-values for the object. If initialized with None, then `x` is initialized the
        first function call to have the same size as the input `data.shape[-2]` and has min
        and max values of -1 and 1, respectively.
    x_domain : numpy.ndarray
        The minimum and maximum values of `x`. If `x_data` is None during initialization, then
        set to numpy.ndarray([-1, 1]).
    z : numpy.ndarray or None
        The z-values for the object. If initialized with None, then `z` is initialized the
        first function call to have the same size as the input `data.shape[-1]` and has min
        and max values of -1 and 1, respectively.
    z_domain : numpy.ndarray
        The minimum and maximum values of `z`. If `z_data` is None during initialization, then
        set to numpy.ndarray([-1, 1]).

    """

    def _get_method(self, method):
        """
        A helper function to allow accessing methods by their string.

        Parameters
        ----------
        method : str
            The name of the desired method as a string. Capitalization is ignored. For
            example, both 'asls' and 'AsLS' would return :meth:`~.Baseline2D.asls`.

        Returns
        -------
        output : Callable
            The callable method corresponding to the input string.

        Raises
        ------
        AttributeError
            Raised if the input method does not exist.
