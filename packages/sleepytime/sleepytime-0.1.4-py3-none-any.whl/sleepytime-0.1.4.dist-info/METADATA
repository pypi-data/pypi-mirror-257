# Sleepytime

A simple gui that can prompt you to hibernate your computer. Use task scheduler to have it prompt you at night.
If you click delay, it'll sleep an hour and prompt you again.

If it detects a mouse movement over the course of the last 5 minutes, it'll wait to start the gui. In other words, as long as the mouse moves
at least once every 5 minutes, it won't prompt to hibernate.

If you delay and want to exit, right click the system tray icon and hit exit.

Right now this only works on Windows... PRs are welcome for other OSes.
