# FLEX-L BMI

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/FLEX-lumped)](https://pypi.org/project/FLEX-lumped/)

Basic Model Interface (BMI) FLEX-lumped model intended for use with [eWaterCycle](https://github.com/eWaterCycle). See said repo for installation instructions. 

FLEX-L is a lumped conceptual hydrological model. Similar to that shown in this [paper](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/18/1895/2014/hess-18-1895-2014.pdf).

Based on model is from the course ENVM1502 - river basin Hydrology (Markus Hrachowitz).

This current implementation is _without_ a snow reservoir. 

Actual eWatercycle model wrapper can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Daafip/ewatercycle-flexlumped)

Feel free to fork/duplicate this repo and publish your own (better) version.


## separate use
Can also be used as a standalone package _in theory_ - not advised:

```console
pip install FLEX-lumped
```

Then HBV becomes available as one of the eWaterCycle models

```python
from FLEX-lumped import FLEXL

model = FLEXL()

```

Be aware of the non-intuitive [BMI](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/grpc4bmi) implementation as this package is designed to run in a [docker](https://github.com/Daafip/Flex-lumped-bmi/pkgs/container/Flex-lumped-bmi-grpc4bmi) container. 


## Changelog

### Pre v1.0.0 
- working basic version after various [testing versions](https://test.pypi.org/project/HBV/)
- various bug fixes etc. (last time using live as a dev branch -> bad practice)
- added support for updating memory vector on the fly for Data assimilation.
- bug fix in `T_lag` value: can now only be set an integer larger than 1: otherwise makes no physical sense
- bug fix where wrong types were given, warning messages cleaned up and code attempted to be made more readable
- pretty big issue with setting values fixed - won't affect most use but will cause issues for Data Assimilation
- use opportunity to name all HBV packages/naming/images to 1.2.0 

### v1.0.0

- release
