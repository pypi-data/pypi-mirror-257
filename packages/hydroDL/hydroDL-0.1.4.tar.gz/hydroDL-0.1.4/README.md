# Installation
There are two different methods for hydroDL installation:

### Create a new environment, then activate it
  ```Shell
conda create -n mhpihydrodl python=3.7
conda activate mhpihydrodl
```

### 1) Using PyPI (stable package)
Install our hydroDL stable package from pip (Python version>=3.7.0)
```
pip install hydroDL
```

### 2) Source latest version
Install our latest hydroDL package from github
```
pip install git+https://github.com/mhpi/hydroDL
```

_Note:_
If you don't have a GPU, please install the cpu version torch first. 

```
pip install torch==1.4.0+cpu torchvision==0.5.0+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```
There exists a small compatibility issue with our code when using the latest pyTorch version. Feel free to contact us if you find any issues or code bugs that you cannot resolve.

# Quick Start:
_The detailed code for quick start can be found in [tutorial_quick_start.py](./example/tutorial_quick_start.py)_

See below for a brief explanation of the major components you need to run a hydroDL model:
```Shell
# imports
from hydroDL.model.crit import RmseLoss
from hydroDL.model.rnn import CudnnLstmModel as LSTM
from hydroDL.model.train import trainModel
from hydroDL.model.test import testModel

# load your training and testing data 
# x: forcing data (pixels, time, features)
# c: attribute data (pixels, features)
# y: observed values (pixels, time, 1)
x_train, c_train, y_train, x_val, c_val, y_val = load_data(...)

# define your model and loss function
model = LSTM(nx=num_variables, ny=1)
loss_fn = RmseLoss()

# train your model
model = trainModel(model,
    x_train,
    y_train,
    c_train,
    loss_fn,
)

# validate your model
pred = testModel(model,
             x_val,
             c_val,
)

```

# Examples

Several examples related to the above papers are presented here. **Click the title link** to see each example.
## [1.Train a LSTM data integration model to make streamflow forecast](example/StreamflowExample-DI.py)
The dataset used is NCAR CAMELS dataset. Download CAMELS following [this link](https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/camels). 
Please download both forcing, observation data `CAMELS time series meteorology, observed flow, meta data (.zip)` and basin attributes `CAMELS Attributes (.zip)`. 
Put two unzipped folders under the same directory, like `your/path/to/Camels/basin_timeseries_v1p2_metForcing_obsFlow`, and `your/path/to/Camels/camels_attributes_v2.0`. Set the directory path `your/path/to/Camels`
as the variable `rootDatabase` inside the code later.

Computational benchmark: training of CAMELS data (w/ or w/o data integration) with 671 basins, 10 years, 300 epochs, in ~1 hour with GPU.

## [2.Train LSTM and CNN-LSTM models for prediction in ungauged regions](example/PUR/trainPUR-Reg.py)
The dataset used is also NCAR CAMELS. Follow the instructions in the first example above to download and unzip the dataset. Use [this code](example/PUR/testPUR-Reg.py) to test your saved models after training finished.
