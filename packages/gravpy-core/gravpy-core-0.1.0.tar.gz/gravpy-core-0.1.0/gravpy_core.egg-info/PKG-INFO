# GravPy
GravPy is a Python package for gravitational field and potential calculations. It is designed to be easy to use and to provide a simple interface for the user. The package is built on top of the `numpy` library and is designed to be used in conjunction with it.  
The package also uses `float256` precision for all calculations, which is the highest precision available in `numpy`.
