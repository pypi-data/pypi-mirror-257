class CrossAttention(BaseAttention):
    """
    A class that implements the cross-attention layer by inheriting from the BaseAttention class.
    This layer is used to process two different sequences and attends to the context sequence while processing the query sequence.

    Methods:
        call: Performs the forward pass of the layer.    

    Attributes:
        mha (tf.keras.layers.MultiHeadAttention): The MultiHeadAttention layer.
        layernorm (tf.keras.layers.LayerNormalization): The LayerNormalization layer.
        add (tf.keras.layers.Add): The Add layer.
    """
    def call(self, x: tf.Tensor, context: tf.Tensor) -> tf.Tensor:
        """
        The call function that performs the cross-attention operation.

        Args:
            x (tf.Tensor): The query (expected Transformer results) sequence of shape (batch_size, seq_length, d_model).
            context (tf.Tensor): The context (inputs to the Encoder layer) sequence of shape (batch_size, seq_length, d_model).

        Returns:
            tf.Tensor: The output sequence of shape (batch_size, seq_length, d_model).
