`decoupler` is a package containing different enrichment statistical methods to extract biological activities from omics data within a unified framework.
This is its faster and memory efficient Python implementation, for the R version go [here](https://github.com/saezlab/decoupleR).

For further information and example tutorials, please check our [documentation](https://decoupler-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

If you have any question or problem do not hesitate to open an [issue](https://github.com/saezlab/decoupler-py/issues).

## Installation

`decoupler` can be installed from `pip` (lightweight installation)::
```
pip install decoupler
```

It can also be installed from `conda` and `mamba` (this includes extra dependencies):
```
mamba create -n=decoupler -c conda-forge -c bioconda decoupler
```

Alternatively, to stay up-to-date with the newest unreleased version, install from source: 
```
pip install git+https://github.com/saezlab/decoupler-py.git
```

## scverse
`decoupler` is part of the [scverse](https://scverse.org) ecosystem, a collection of tools for single-cell omics data analysis in python.
