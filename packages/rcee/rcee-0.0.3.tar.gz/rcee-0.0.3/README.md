# Remote code execution endpoint

## Some nice to haves left to implement.

- Monospace font on the command output.
- Error handling.
- Tests.

## Deploying a remote code execution endpoint

Drop into a shell and sing the magic incantation `pip install rcee` and `rcee`.
This will leave you haunted with an endpoint lingering on port `7999` by default.
From this point onward you're on your own and can perform any request you want.

> It's also possible to use pipx for the installation.
