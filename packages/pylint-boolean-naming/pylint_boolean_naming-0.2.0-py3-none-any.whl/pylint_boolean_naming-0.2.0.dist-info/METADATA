# Pylint Boolean Naming Checker

This is a [pylint](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) Checker to enforce variables with boolean results include common phrases implying True/False states.

    <summary>Inspiration taken from here</summary>

    Came across this [issue](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9409) and thought it would be cool to try and do it myself.

    ... # other commands
```
