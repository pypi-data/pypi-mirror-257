managed,Managed solid waste disposal site (anaerobic).,"These must have controlled placement of waste (i.e., waste directed to specific deposition areas, a degree of control of scavenging and a degree of control of fires) and will include at least one of the following, (i) cover material; (ii) mechanical compacting; or (iii) levelling of the waste.",38.21,Treatment and disposal of non-hazerdoues waste
managed_well_s-a,Well managed solid waste disposal site (semi-aerobic).,"When semi-aerobic managed swdS type is managed under one of the following condition, it is regarded as well magement ; (i) permeable cover material; (ii) leachate drainage system without sunk; (iii) regulating pondage; and (iv) gas ventilation system without cap, (v) connection of leachate drainage system and gas ventilation system.",38.21,Treatment and disposal of non-hazerdoues waste
managed_poorly_s-a,Poorly managed solid waste disposal site (semi-aerobic).,"When semi-aerobic managed swdS type is managed under one of the following condition, it is regarded as poor management; (i) condition of sunk of leachate drainage system; (ii) closing of valve of drainage or atmosphere-unopening of drainage exit; (iii) capping of gas ventilation exit.",38.21,Treatment and disposal of non-hazerdoues waste
managed_well_a-a,Well managed solid waste disposal site (active-reaction).,"Active aeration of managed landfills includes the technology of in-situ low pressure aeration, air sparging, bioventing, passive ventilation with extraction (suction). These must have controlled placement of waste and will include leachate drainage system to avoid the blockage of air penetration, and (i) cover material; (ii) air injection or gas extraction system without drying of waste.",38.21,Treatment and disposal of non-hazerdoues waste
managed_poorly_a-a,Poorly managed solid waste disposal site (active-reaction).,"When swdS, that is equipped as well as active aeration of managed swdS, is managed under one of the following condition, it is judged as poor management; (i) blockage of aeration system due to failure of drainage; (ii) lack of available moisture for microorganisms due to high- pressure aeration.",38.21,Treatment and disposal of non-hazerdoues waste
unmanaged_deep,"Unmanaged solid waste disposal site (depth greater, equal 5 metres).","All swdS not meeting the criteria of managed swdS and which have depths of greater than or equal to 5 metres and/or high water table at near ground level. Latter situation corresponds to filling inland water, such as pond, river or wetland, by waste.",38.21,Treatment and disposal of non-hazerdoues waste
unmanaged_shallow,Unmanaged solid waste disposal site (depth lower 5 metres).,All swdS not meeting the criteria of managed swdS and which have depths of less than 5 metres.,38.21,Treatment and disposal of non-hazerdoues waste
uncharacterised,Uncharacterised solid waste disposal site (if above not applicable).,"Only if countries cannot categorise its swdS into above four categories of managed and unmanaged swdS, the MCF for this category can be used.",38.21,Treatment and disposal of non-hazerdoues waste
