PyRLprob is an open-source python library for training, evaluation, and postprocessing of [Gym](https://gym.openai.com/)-based environments, written in Python, through [Ray-RLlib](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/rllib.html) reinforcement learning library.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the latest stable release of pyRLprob, with all its dependencies:
