        Implements mutation of a protein using the FoldX tool.

        Currently, this method is a stub and does not actually integrate with
        FoldX. In a real implementation, code would be added to interact with
        the FoldX software, passing the protein and mutation information, and
        then capturing and processing the results into a new Protein instance.

        Parameters:
            protein (Protein): The protein to be mutated.
            mutation (Mutation): The mutation details.
