# Laniakea Spark
[![Build & Test](https://github.com/lkhq/laniakea-spark/actions/workflows/python.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lkhq/laniakea-spark/actions/workflows/python.yml)

Spark is the generic Laniakea job runner and package build executor.
It is able to perform a variety of tasks on dedicated builder machines,
like building packages, distribution ISO images or performing longer QA tasks.

Spark instances communicate with Lighthouse servers via ZeroMQ to fetch new jobs and
report information. They auto-register with the master system, if they were provided
with the right credentials for the respective instance.
