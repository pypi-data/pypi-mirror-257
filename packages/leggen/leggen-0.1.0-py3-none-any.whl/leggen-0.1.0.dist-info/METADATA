# leggen

An Open Banking CLI.

## Features
  - Connect to banks using GoCardless Open Banking API
  - List all connected banks and their status
  - List balances of all connected accounts
  - List transactions for an account
  - Sync all transactions with a MongoDB database

## Installation and Configuration

In order to use `leggen`, you need to create a GoCardless account. GoCardless is a service that provides access to Open Banking APIs. You can create an account at https://gocardless.com/bank-account-data/.

After creating an account and getting your API keys, the best way is to use the [compose file](docker-compose.yml). Open the file and adapt it to your needs. Then run the following command:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

The leggen container will exit, this is expected. Now you can run the following command to create the configuration file:

```bash
$ docker compose run leggen init
```

Now you need to connect your bank accounts. Run the following command and follow the instructions:

```bash
$ docker compose run leggen bank add
```

To sync all transactions with the database, run the following command:

```bash
$ docker compose run leggen sync
```
