# medkit - documentation

***medkit*** is a Python library for facilitating the **extraction of features** from various modalities of patient data: text, audio for now - relational, image, genetic, and others soon. To this end, medkit offers to compose pipelines with modules, developed by us, yourself or others.

We pay particular attention to enable the implementation of **non-destructive pipelines** (no loss of information when passing from a module to another) and a flexible tracing of **data provenance**.

***medkit*** aims at accelerating the development of a learning health system, with a strong open-source and community orientation.

:::{warning}
*medkit* core library is still under development and testing.
Some interfaces may change in the future.

This library with its documentation is shared for following reasons:
* helping people with some guidelines for using first medkit versions,
* helping core development team to get user feedback for improving the *medkit* library.
