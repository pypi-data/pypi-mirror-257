# slow-learner — python type inference tool

See also: [post](https://nj-vs-vh.name/project/slow-learner)

A library and CLI to consume a stream of values (for CLI — JSON documents) and
generate Python types describing it. Features:
- recursion into mappings and collections with generic types generation
- "structured dicts" are turned into `TypedDict`s by default
- values with a small set of observed values are turned into `Literal`s
