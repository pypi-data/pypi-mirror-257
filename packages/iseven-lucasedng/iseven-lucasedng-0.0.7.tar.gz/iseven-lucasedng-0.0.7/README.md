## Examples of How To Use

Using is_even method

```python
from is_even import is_even

# Check if a number is even
number = 4
if is_even(number):
    print(f"{number} is even.")
else:
    print(f"{number} is not even.")
```
This simple library allows you to easily check if a number is even. The is_even method takes an integer as input and returns `True` if the number is even, and `False` otherwise.
