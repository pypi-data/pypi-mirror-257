### (Semantic) Highlighting âœ…

Currently, the server is using the _Semantic Tokens_ feature to do **all** highlighting.
That means that no highlighting logic has to be present on the client (like TextMate grammars).
Note that this may change in the future.

All highlighting logic is done using the [Tree-Sitter queries](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/using-parsers#pattern-matching-with-queries).
See `queries/highlights.scm` (WooWoo without metablocks) and `queries/yaml-highlights.scm` (for the yaml meta-blocks).
