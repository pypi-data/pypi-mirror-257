# Kothon

Kothon is a Python library designed to bring the elegance and functionality of Kotlin's Sequence class into the Python ecosystem. With an emphasis on functional programming paradigms, Kothon enables Python developers to leverage lazy-evaluated sequences, allowing for efficient and expressive data processing pipelines.

## Features

- **Lazy Evaluation**: Kothon sequences are evaluated lazily, meaning computations are deferred until the value is needed, enhancing performance especially for large datasets.
- **Functional Programming**: Embrace functional programming with a rich set of operators like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and much more, enabling you to write more declarative and concise code.
- **Interoperability**: Seamlessly integrate with existing Python codebases, enjoying the benefits of Kotlin-like sequences without disrupting your current workflow.
- **Easy to Use**: Kothon's API is designed to be intuitive for both Python and Kotlin developers, ensuring a smooth learning curve.

## Installation

To install Kothon, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install kothon
```

## Quick Start

Here's a quick example to get you started with Kothon:

```python
from kothon import Seq

# Create a Kothon sequence
seq = Seq(range(10))

# Apply some functional operations
result = seq \
    .filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0) \
    .map(lambda x: x * 2) \
    .to_list()

print(result)  # Output: [0, 4, 8, 12, 16]
```
