# Installation

See our general advice
[on using Python](https://fluiddyn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advice_on_Python.html) and
[on installing a good scientific Python environment](https://fluiddyn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_good_Python_env.html).

## The simplest method (with conda)

The simplest method to install FluidImage is to use `conda` (installed with miniconda)
and the conda-forge channel (activated with the command
`conda config --add channels conda-forge`).

To just install FluidImage, you can run:

```
conda install fluidimage
```

Alternativally, you can install FluidImage in a dedicated conda environment with:

```
conda create -n env_fluidimage fluidimage
```

If you use an environment, you will need to activate it with
`conda activate env_fluidimage`.

## Slightly more complicated: with pip, from the package on PyPI or the repository

FluidImage depends on Python >= 3.6 and on Python packages that are today very simple to
install with pip or conda, namely numpy, scipy, matplotlib, h5py, scikit-image, pyfftw
and IPython. You should not care about these dependencies because they are going to be
installed automatically for you.

PyQt5 is used only for some graphical user interfaces, so you need to install it manually
if needed. This can be done with `pip install pyqt5` or `conda install pyqt`.

I would also advice to install Jupyterlab, which interacts nicely with FluidImage.

### To compile, or not to compile?

We choose to use the static Python compiler
[Pythran](https://github.com/serge-sans-paille/pythran) for some numerical functions. Our
microbenchmarks show that the performances are as good as what we are able to get with
Fortran or C++!

We don't upload "wheels" (package with already compiled binaries) on PyPI, so installing
with pip *usually* involves local compilation.

To disable Pythran compilation during build, one can set the environment variable
`DISABLE_PYTHRAN`.

If Pythran is used, you need a C++ compiler (we recommend clang). With conda, it's very
easy to install clang with `conda install clangdev`.

Finally, for better performance, Pythran needs a configuration file with something like
(see the [Pythran documentation](https://pythran.readthedocs.io/en/latest/MANUAL.html)):

```
[pythran]
complex_hook = True

[compiler]
CXX = clang++
CC = clang
```

### Ready? Let's install with pip

To install the last version of FluidImage uploaded to the Python Package Index:

```
pip install fluidimage -U
```

However, the project is in an active phase of development so it can be better to use the
last version (from the mercurial repository hosted on Heptapod). Moreover, like that, you
get all examples and tutorials! For FluidImage, we use the revision control software
Mercurial and the main repository is hosted in
<https://foss.heptapod.net/fluiddyn/fluidimage>, so you can get the source with the
command:

```
hg clone https://foss.heptapod.net/fluiddyn/fluidimage
```

If you are new with Mercurial and Heptapod, you can also read
[this short tutorial](http://fluiddyn.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mercurial_heptapod.html).

If you really can't use Mercurial, you can also just manually download the package from
[the Heptapod page](https://foss.heptapod.net/fluiddyn/fluidimage) or from
[the PyPI page](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fluidimage).

To install in development mode:

```
cd fluidimage
pip install -e .
```

After the installation, it is a good practice to run the unit tests by running `pytest`
from the root directory.
