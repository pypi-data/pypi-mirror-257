    The median target algorithm calculates a recovery target by
    sequentially computing the median over a specified time window from
    a stack of image data. The stack is expected to have dimensions for
    time, bands, and spatial coordinates. Additional median calculations
    are performed based on the scale ("polygon" or "pixel") and the
    presence of a "poly_id" dimension.

    Attributes
    ----------
    scale : {"polygon", "pixel"}
        The scale to compute target for. Either 'polygon' which results
        in one value per-band (median of the polygon(s) across time), or
        'pixel' which results in a value for each pixel per-band (median
        of each pixel across time).

        Median recovery target.

        Sequentially computes the median over time and, optionally, the
        spatial dimensions (x and y). If there is a "poly_id" dimension,
        then the median is automatically computed along that dimension
        after the time and space dimensions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        image_stack : xr.DataArray
            DataArray of images to derive historic average from. Must have at least
            4 labelled dimensions: "time", "band", "y" and "x" and optionally,
            "poly_id".
        reference_date : Union[datetime, Tuple[datetime]]
