ImmPy is a small Python library that provides operations for detecting and processing stops in indoor trajectories.
The library includes the following functionalities:
(i) Studying and implementing an existing algorithm (SPD) for determining stops.
(ii) Defining and implementing a method to associate stops with POIs (Point of Interest).
(iii) Defining methods to export obtained data related to stop sequences.
(iv) Methods for aggregating stops into higher-level information called visits.
