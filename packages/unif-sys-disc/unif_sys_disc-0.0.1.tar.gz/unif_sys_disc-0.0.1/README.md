# Unified System Discovery Framework

The unified system discovery framework realizes a data-driven model generation 
methodology that takes event logs, signal waveforms and domain knowledge as 
input and automatically creates three types of models, including graph models, 
Petri nets and automata, to provide different views of the production system 
under study.
