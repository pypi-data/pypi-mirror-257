# zreprt

ZAP and ZAP-like reporting facility

Structures here resemble OWASPÂ® ZAP Traditional JSON Report, with or without Requests and Responses. Alerts are considered grouped by their info.

Changes to the Traditional JSON Report format:

- some fields renamed, keeping original names as aliases;
- some (re)typing: timestamps are ISO-formatted,
    some int and bool instead of strings;
- html tags are stripped from some fields containing descriptions.
