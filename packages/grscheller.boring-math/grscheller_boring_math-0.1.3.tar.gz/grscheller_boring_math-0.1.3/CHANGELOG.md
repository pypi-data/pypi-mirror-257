## Veresion v0.1.2 - PyPI release date 2024-01-30

* now needs CircularArray v0.1.2
  * integer_math comb uses new foldL method of CircularArray
  * CircularArray was split out of grscheller.satastructures
* test suite written

## Veresion v0.1.1 - PyPI release date 2024-01-20

* fixed some negative value edge cases
  * lcm(0,0) now gives 0 instead of a divide by zero exception
    * some authors leave lcm(0, 0) as undefined
    * lcm(0, 0) = 0 does make sense
      * since a*0 = 0 for all a >= 0
      * 0 is the smallest non-negative interger a such that a*0 = 0
      * most math theorems remain true for this case
* README.md improvements
