              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Small DI framework with scopes and agreeable API.

### Purpose

This library is targeting to provide only an IoC-container. If you are tired manually passing objects to create others objects which are only used to create more object - we have a solution. Otherwise, you do not probably need a IoC-container but check what we have.

Unlike other instruments we are not trying to solve tasks not related to dependency injection. We want to keep DI in place, not soiling you code with global variables and additional specifiers in all places. 

Main ideas:
* **Scopes**. Any object can have lifespan of the whole app, single request or even more fractionally. Many frameworks do not have scopes or have only 2 of them. Here you can have as many scopes as you need.
* **Finalization**. Some dependencies like database connections must be not only created, but carefully released. Many framework lack this essential feature
* **Modular providers**. Instead of creating lots of separate functions or contrariwise a big single class, you can split your factories into several classes, which makes them simpler reusable.
* **Clean dependencies**. You do not need to add custom markers to the code of dependencies so to allow library to see them. All customization is done within providers code and only borders of scopes have to deal with library API.
* **Simple API**. You need minimum of objects to start using library. You can easily integrate it with your task framework, examples provided. 
* **Speed**. It is fast enough so you not to worry about. It is even faster than many of the analogs.

See more in [technical requirements](https://dishka.readthedocs.io/en/latest/requirements/technical.html)

### Quickstart

1. Create Provider subclass. 
```python
from dishka import Provider
class MyProvider(Provider):
   ...
```
2. Mark methods which actually create dependencies with `@provide` decorator with carefully arranged scopes. Do not forget to place correct typehints for parameters and result.
Here we describe how to create instances of A and B classes, where B class requires itself an instance of A.
```python
from dishka import provide, Provider, Scope
class MyProvider(Provider):
   @provide(scope=Scope.APP)
   def get_a(self) -> A:
      return A()

   @provide(scope=Scope.REQUEST)
   def get_b(self, a: A) -> B:
      return B(a)
```
4. Create Container instance passing providers, and step into `APP` scope. Or deeper if you need.
```python
with make_container(MyProvider()) as container:  # enter Scope.APP
     with container() as request_container:   # enter Scope.REQUEST
          ...
```

5. Call `get` to get dependency and use context manager to get deeper through scopes
```python
with make_container(MyProvider()) as container:
     a = container.get(A)  # `A` has Scope.APP, so it is accessible here
     with container() as request_container:
          b = request_container.get(B)  # `B` has Scope.REQUEST
          a = request_container.get(A)  # `A` is accessible here too
```

6. Add decorators and middleware for your framework (_would be described soon_)

See [examples](examples)

### Concepts

**Dependency** is what you need for some part of your code to work. They are just object which you do not create in place and probably want to replace some day. At least for tests.
Some of them can live while you application is running, others are destroyed and created on each request. Dependencies can depend on other objects, which are their dependencies.

**Scope** is a lifespan of a dependency. Standard scopes are:

  `APP` -> `REQUEST` -> `ACTION` -> `STEP`.

You decide when to enter and exit them, but it is done one by one. You set a scope for your dependency when you configure how to create it. If the same dependency is requested multiple time within one scope without leaving it, then by default the same instance is returned.

If you are developing web application, you would enter `APP` scope on startup, and you would `REQUEST` scope in each HTTP-request.

You can provide your own Scopes class if you are not satisfied with standard flow.

**Container** is what you use to get your dependency. You just call `.get(SomeType)` and it finds a way to get you an instance of that type. It does not create things itself, but manages their lifecycle and caches. It delegates objects creation to providers which are passed during creation.


**Provider** is a collection of functions which really provide some objects. 
Provider itself is a class with some attributes and methods. Each of them is either result of `provide`, `alias` or `decorate`.

`@provide` can be used as a decorator for some method. This method will be called when corresponding dependency has to be created. Name of the method is not important: just check that it is different form other `Provider` attributes. Type hints do matter: they show what this method creates and what does it require. All method parameters are treated as other dependencies and created using container.

If `provide` is used with some class then that class itself is treated as a factory (`__init__` is analyzed for parameters). But do not forget to assing that call to some attribute otherwise it will be ignored.



### Tips

* Add method and mark it with `@provide` decorator. It can be sync or async method returning some value.
    ```python
    class MyProvider(Provider):
        @provide(scope=Scope.REQUEST)
        def get_a(self) -> A:
            return A()
    ```
* Want some finalization when exiting the scope? Make that method generator:
    ```python
    class MyProvider(Provider):
        @provide(scope=Scope.REQUEST)
        def get_a(self) -> Iterable[A]:
            a = A()
            yield a
            a.close()
    ```
* Do not have any specific logic and just want to create class using its `__init__`? then add a provider attribute using `provide` as function passing that class. 
    ```python 
    class MyProvider(Provider):
        a = provide(A, scope=Scope.REQUEST)
    ```
* Want to create a child class instance when parent is requested? add a `source` attribute to `provide` function with a parent class while passing child as a first parameter
    ```python 
    class MyProvider(Provider):
        a = provide(source=AChild, scope=Scope.REQUEST, provides=A)
    ```
* Having multiple interfaces which can be created as a same class with defined provider? Use alias:
    ```python
    class MyProvider(Provider):
        p = alias(source=A, provides=AProtocol)
    ```
    it works the same way as
    ```python
    class MyProvider(Provider):
        @provide(scope=<Scope of A>)
        def p(self, a: A) -> AProtocol:
            return a
    ```

* Want to apply decorator pattern and do not want to alter existing provide method? Use `decorate`. It will construct object using earlie defined provider and then pass it to your decorator before returning from the container.
  ```python
    class MyProvider(Provider):
        @decorate
        def decorate_a(self, a: A) -> A:
            return ADecorator(a)
   ```
  Decorator function can also have additional parameters.

* Want to go `async`? Make provide methods asynchronous. Create async container. Use `async with` and await `get` calls:
```python
class MyProvider(Provider):
   @provide(scope=Scope.APP)
   async def get_a(self) -> A:
      return A()

async with make_async_container(MyProvider()) as container:
     a = await container.get(A)
```

* Having some data connected with scope which you want to use when solving dependencies? Set it when entering scope. These classes can be used as parameters of your `provide` methods
```python
with make_container(MyProvider(), context={App: app}) as container:
    with container(context={RequestClass: request_instance}) as request_container:
        pass
```

* Having to many dependencies? Or maybe want to replace only part of them in tests keeping others? Create multiple `Provider` classes
```python
with make_container(MyProvider(), OtherProvider()) as container:
```

* Tired of providing `scope==` for each depedency? Set it inside your `Provider` class and all dependencies with no scope will use it.
```python

class MyProvider(Provider):
   scope=Scope.APP

   @provide
   async def get_a(self) -> A:
      return A()
```
