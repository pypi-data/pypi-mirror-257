    Pipeline component for transforming an image. The service is designed for applying transform predictors that
    take an image as numpy array as input and return the same. The service itself will change the underlying metadata
    like height and width of the returned transform.

    This component is meant to be used at the very first stage of a pipeline. If components have already returned image
    annotations then this component will currently not re-calculate bounding boxes in terms of the transformed image.
    It will raise a warning (at runtime) if image annotations have already been appended.
