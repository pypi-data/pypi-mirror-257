# DirecTracer

DirecTracer is a Python script that generates a directory structure in both text and Markdown formats. It can be used to visualize the hierarchy of folders and files in a given directory, while also excluding specific folders and file extensions.

## Features

- Generates a directory structure in text and Markdown formats.
- Supports ignoring specific directories and file extensions.
- Outputs clickable links in the Markdown file for easy navigation.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository or download the `DirecTracer.py` file.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hardvan/DirecTracer
   cd DirecTracer
   ```

3. Run the script with the following command:

   ```bash
   python DirecTracer.py
   ```

4. Once the script completes, you'll find the generated text and Markdown files in the same directory.

To call the function `save_directory_structure` from another Python script, you can use the following code:

```python
from DirecTracer import save_directory_structure

save_directory_structure(
    directory="path/to/directory",
    ignore_dirs=["dir1", "dir2"],
    ignore_exts=[".ext1", ".ext2"],
)
```

It has the following arguments:

- **root_dir (str):** The root directory to start scanning from.
- **text_output_file (str):** The name of the text output file.
- **markdown_output_file (str):** The name of the Markdown output file.
- **ignored_directories (list, optional):** List of directories to ignore. Defaults to None.
- **ignored_extensions (list, optional):** List of file extensions to ignore. Defaults to None.
- **animation (bool, optional):** Enable/Disable the loading animation. Defaults to False.
