# Define panos-upgrade-assurance options
class AssuranceOptions:
    """
    Centralizes configuration options for readiness checks, reports, and state snapshots in the upgrade assurance process.

    This class provides a structured approach to define and access various configuration options related to the upgrade
    assurance process for Palo Alto Networks devices. It outlines available readiness checks, types of reports, and
    categories of state snapshots that can be utilized during the device upgrade process. These configurations are
    designed to be flexible, allowing customization through an external `settings.yaml` file to cater to specific
    operational needs and preferences.

    Attributes
    ----------
    READINESS_CHECKS : dict
        A dictionary mapping the names of readiness checks to their attributes, which include descriptions, associated
        log levels, and flags to indicate whether to exit the process upon check failure. These checks are designed to
        ensure a device's readiness for an upgrade by validating its operational and configuration status.
    REPORTS : dict
        A dictionary enumerating the types of reports that can be generated to offer insights into the device's state
        before and after an upgrade. These reports encompass aspects like ARP tables, content versions, IPsec tunnels,
        licenses, network interfaces, routing tables, and session statistics.
    STATE_SNAPSHOTS : dict
        A dictionary listing the categories of state snapshots that can be captured to document essential data about
        the device's current state. These snapshots are crucial for diagnostics and verifying the device's operational
        status before proceeding with the upgrade.

    Examples
    --------
    Accessing the log level for the 'active_support' readiness check:
        >>> log_level = AssuranceOptions.READINESS_CHECKS['active_support']['log_level']
        >>> print(log_level)
        'warning'

    Iterating through all available report types:
        >>> for report_type in AssuranceOptions.REPORTS:
        ...     print(report_type)
        'arp_table'
        'content_version'
        ...

    Notes
    -----
    - The configurations for readiness checks, report types, and state snapshots provided in this class can be selectively
      enabled or customized through the `settings.yaml` file. This allows users to adapt the upgrade assurance process
      to their specific requirements and scenarios.
    - Default settings are predefined within this class; however, they can be overridden by specifying custom configurations
      in the `settings.yaml` file, thus enhancing the script's flexibility and adaptability to different upgrade contexts.

# Core Functions
def backup_configuration(
    target_device: Union[Firewall, Panorama],
    hostname: str,
    file_path: str,
) -> bool:
    """
    Backs up the running configuration of a Palo Alto Networks device to a specified file.

    This function exports the current running configuration from the given device, which can be either a Firewall or
    Panorama, and writes it to a local file in XML format. The backup operation is an essential precautionary measure
    prior to performing system updates, modifications, or troubleshooting, providing a reliable rollback point.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target_device : Union[Firewall, Panorama]
        The device instance from which to back up the configuration. This must be an initialized object of type
        Firewall or Panorama with active connectivity to the device.
    hostname : str
        A string representing the hostname or IP address of the target device, used primarily for logging purposes.
    file_path : str
        The full path to the file where the configuration backup will be saved. If the directory path does not exist,
        it will be created.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Returns True if the backup is successful, indicating the configuration has been safely written to the specified
        file. Returns False if any part of the backup process fails, such as issues with retrieving the configuration or
        writing to the file.

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        Raises a generic Exception if an unexpected error occurs during the backup process, including issues with
        retrieving the configuration from the device or writing to the specified file.

    Examples
    --------
    Backing up the configuration of a firewall:
        >>> firewall = Firewall(hostname='192.168.1.1', api_username='admin', api_password='adminpassword')
        >>> backup_configuration(firewall, '192.168.1.1', '/path/to/firewall_backup.xml')
        True  # Assuming the backup was successful

    Backing up the configuration of a Panorama appliance:
        >>> panorama = Panorama(hostname='panorama.example.com', api_username='admin', api_password='adminpassword')
        >>> backup_configuration(panorama, 'panorama.example.com', '/path/to/panorama_backup.xml')
        True  # Assuming the backup was successful

    Notes
    -----
    - The backed-up configuration is saved in XML format, mirroring the exact state of the device's configuration at
      the time of the backup.
    - It is recommended to periodically back up configurations, especially before significant system changes, to ensure
      a recovery point is available.
    - While this function provides an essential capability in device management workflows, users should handle the
      backup files securely and maintain appropriate file permissions to protect sensitive configuration data.

    Evaluates if an upgrade is necessary for the specified device to reach the desired PAN-OS version.

    This function assesses the current PAN-OS version of the target device against the specified target version. If the
    current version is older than the target version, it indicates that an upgrade is required. Conversely, if the current
    version is the same as or more recent than the target version, the function logs that no upgrade is needed, and it
    terminates the script to prevent unnecessary operations. This evaluation helps in maintaining the device's firmware
    up-to-date or avoiding inadvertent downgrades.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target_device : Union[Firewall, Panorama]
        The device (Firewall or Panorama) to be evaluated for an upgrade. This must be an initialized instance with
        connectivity to the device.
    hostname : str
        The hostname or IP address of the target device. It is used for logging purposes to clearly identify the device
        in log messages.
    target_major : int
        The major version component of the desired PAN-OS version (e.g., '10' in PAN-OS 10.0.0).
    target_minor : int
        The minor version component of the desired PAN-OS version (e.g., '0' in PAN-OS 10.0.0).
    target_maintenance : Union[int, str]
        The maintenance or hotfix version component of the desired PAN-OS version. It can be an integer for standard
        maintenance releases or a string for hotfixes (e.g., '1-h1' in PAN-OS 10.0.1-h1).

    Raises
    ------
    SystemExit
        If the function determines that an upgrade is not required or if a downgrade is attempted, it will log the
        appropriate message and terminate the script to prevent further execution.

    Examples
    --------
    Checking if a firewall requires an upgrade to PAN-OS 9.1.0:
        >>> firewall = Firewall(hostname='192.168.1.1', api_username='admin', api_password='adminpassword')
        >>> determine_upgrade(firewall, '192.168.1.1', 9, 1, 0)
        # Logs the current version and whether an upgrade to 9.1.0 is necessary.

    Checking if a Panorama appliance requires an upgrade to PAN-OS 10.0.1-h1:
        >>> panorama = Panorama(hostname='panorama.example.com', api_username='admin', api_password='adminpassword')
        >>> determine_upgrade(panorama, 'panorama.example.com', 10, 0, '1-h1')
        # Logs the current version and whether an upgrade to 10.0.1-h1 is necessary.

    Notes
    -----
    - The current and target versions are parsed and compared in a structured manner to accurately determine the need for
      an upgrade.
    - This function is crucial for maintaining device firmware integrity by ensuring that only necessary upgrades are
      performed and that downgrades are avoided.
    - The decision to halt the script upon determining that no upgrade is required or a downgrade is attempted is a
      safeguard against unintended firmware changes that could affect device stability and security.

    target_device : Union[Firewall, Panorama]
        The device from which HA information is to be retrieved. This must be an initialized instance of either
        a Firewall or Panorama, with connectivity established to the device.
    hostname : str
        The hostname or IP address of the target device, used for logging purposes to aid in identifying the device in log entries.

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[str, Optional[dict]]
        A tuple where the first element is a string representing the HA mode of the device, such as 'standalone',
        'active/passive', 'active/active', or 'cluster'. The second element is an optional dictionary containing
        detailed HA configuration information, provided if the device is part of an HA setup; otherwise, None is returned.

    Example
    -------
    Fetching HA status for a firewall:
        >>> firewall = Firewall(hostname='192.168.1.1', api_username='admin', api_password='adminpassword')
        >>> ha_mode, ha_config = get_ha_status(firewall, '192.168.1.1')
        >>> print(ha_mode)  # Output might be 'active/passive'
        >>> if ha_config:
        ...     print(ha_config)  # Prints detailed HA configuration if available

    Notes
    -----
    - The HA status is essential for ensuring proper maintenance procedures, especially in environments where high availability
      is critical.
    - This function provides detailed insights into the HA setup, aiding in the planning and execution of device upgrades,
      maintenance, and troubleshooting procedures.

    """
    Determines and handles High Availability (HA) logic for the target device during the upgrade process.

    This function assesses the HA configuration of the specified target device to decide the appropriate course of action for
    the upgrade. It considers the device's role in an HA setup (active, passive, or standalone) and uses the 'dry_run' flag to
    determine whether to simulate or execute the upgrade. Based on the device's HA status and synchronization state with its
    HA peer, the function guides whether to proceed with the upgrade and performs HA-specific preparations if necessary.

    Parameters

        The device being evaluated for upgrade. It must be an instance of Firewall and might be part of
        an HA configuration.
    hostname : str
        The hostname or IP address of the target device for identification and logging purposes.
    dry_run : bool
        A flag indicating whether to simulate the upgrade process (True) without making actual changes or to proceed with
        the upgrade (False).

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[bool, Optional[Firewall]]
        A tuple where the first element is a boolean indicating whether the upgrade process should continue, and the second
        element is an optional device instance representing the HA peer if relevant and applicable.

    Example
    -------

) -> None:
    """
    Conducts a set of predefined readiness checks on a specified Palo Alto Networks Firewall to verify its
    preparedness for an upgrade operation.

    This function systematically executes a series of checks on the specified firewall, evaluating various
    aspects such as configuration status, licensing validity, software version compatibility, and more, to
    ascertain its readiness for an upgrade. The outcomes of these checks are meticulously compiled into a
    detailed JSON report, which is then saved to the specified file path. The scope of checks performed can
    be tailored through configurations in the `settings.yaml` file, providing the flexibility to adapt the
    checks to specific operational needs or preferences.

    Parameters
    ----------
    firewall : Firewall
        An instance of the Firewall class, properly initialized with necessary authentication details and
        network connectivity to the target firewall device.
    hostname : str
        A string representing the hostname or IP address of the firewall, utilized for logging and
        identification purposes within the process.
    file_path : str
        The designated file path where the JSON-formatted report summarizing the results of the readiness
        checks will be stored. The function ensures the existence of the specified directory, creating it
        if necessary.

    Raises
    ------
    IOError
        Signals an issue with writing the readiness report to the specified file path, potentially due to
        file access restrictions or insufficient disk space, warranting further investigation.

    Examples
    --------
    Executing readiness checks for a firewall and saving the results:
        >>> firewall_instance = Firewall(hostname='192.168.1.1', api_username='admin', api_password='admin')
        >>> perform_readiness_checks(firewall_instance, 'firewall1', '/path/to/firewall1_readiness_report.json')
        # This command initiates the readiness checks on the specified firewall and saves the generated report
        # to the given file path.

    Notes
    -----
    - The execution of readiness checks is a pivotal preliminary step in the upgrade process, designed to
      uncover and address potential impediments, thereby facilitating a seamless and successful upgrade.
    - The set of checks to be conducted can be customized via the `settings.yaml` file. If this file is
      present and contains specific configurations under the `readiness_checks.customize` key, those
      configurations will dictate the checks to be performed. In the absence of such custom configurations,
      a default set of checks, determined by the `enabled_by_default` attribute within the AssuranceOptions
      class, will be applied.

    Initiates a reboot on a specified device (Firewall or Panorama) and verifies it boots up with the desired PAN-OS version.
    This function is critical in completing the upgrade process, ensuring that the device is running the expected software version
    post-reboot. It also supports High Availability (HA) configurations, checking for the HA pair's synchronization and functional status
    after the reboot.

    The process sends a reboot command to the device, waits for it to go offline and come back online, and then checks if the rebooted
    PAN-OS version matches the target version. For devices in an HA setup, additional steps are taken to verify the HA status and
    synchronization between the HA peers post-reboot.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target_device : Union[Firewall, Panorama]
        The device object representing either a Firewall or Panorama, with necessary connectivity details.
    hostname : str
        The hostname or IP address of the target device, used for identification in logs and status messages.
    target_version : str
        The PAN-OS version that the device should be running after the reboot.
    ha_details : Optional[dict], default None
        A dictionary containing High Availability configuration details, if applicable, to ensure HA coherence post-reboot.
    initial_sleep_duration : int, default 60
        The initial waiting period (in seconds) after issuing the reboot command, before starting to check the device's status.

    Raises
    ------
    SystemExit
        If the device fails to reboot to the specified PAN-OS version after a set number of retries, or if HA synchronization
        is not achieved post-reboot, the script will terminate with an error.

    Examples
    --------
    Rebooting a device post-upgrade and verifying its PAN-OS version:
        >>> firewall = Firewall(hostname='192.168.1.1', api_username='admin', api_password='admin')
        >>> perform_reboot(firewall, 'fw1', '10.1.0')

    """
    Executes specified operational tasks, such as readiness checks or state snapshots, on a firewall based on the given
    operation type. This function is a versatile tool for conducting various operational checks or capturing the current
    state of the firewall for analysis. It uses a list of actions relevant to the chosen operation type and additional
    configuration parameters to customize the execution. Depending on the operation's success and type, it returns a
    report object or None in case of failure or if the operation type is invalid.

    Parameters
    ----------
    firewall : Firewall
        The Firewall object representing the device on which the assurance operations will be performed. This object
        must be initialized and authenticated prior to use.
    hostname : str
        The hostname or IP address of the firewall. This is used for identification and logging purposes.
    operation_type : str
        A string specifying the type of operation to perform. Supported types include 'readiness_check' and 'state_snapshot'.
    actions : List[str]
        A list of actions to be performed as part of the operation. The valid actions depend on the operation type.
    config : Dict[str, Union[str, int, float, bool]]
        A dictionary of additional configuration options that customize the operation. These might include thresholds,
        specific elements to check, or other operation-specific parameters.

    Returns
    -------
    Union[SnapshotReport, ReadinessCheckReport, None]
        Depending on the operation type, returns a SnapshotReport, ReadinessCheckReport, or None if the operation fails
        or the operation type is invalid.

    Raises
    ------
    SystemExit
        Exits the script if an invalid action is specified for the given operation type or if an unrecoverable error
        occurs during the operation execution.

    Examples
    --------
    Executing readiness checks before a firewall upgrade:
        >>> firewall = Firewall(hostname='192.168.1.1', api_username='admin', api_password='password')
        >>> result = run_assurance(firewall, '192.168.1.1', 'readiness_check', ['pending_changes', 'system_health'], {})
        # This might return a ReadinessCheckReport object with the results of the specified checks.

    Capturing the current state of a firewall for analysis:
        >>> result = run_assurance(firewall, '192.168.1.1', 'state_snapshot', ['arp_table', 'routes'], {})
        # This might return a SnapshotReport object with the current state information of the specified elements.

    Notes
    -----
    - The 'operation_type' parameter is key to defining the nature of the operation, making this function adaptable to
      a wide range of firewall management and diagnostic tasks.
    - This function is designed for extensibility, allowing new operation types and associated actions to be added as
      operational needs evolve.
    - Some operational parameters can be dynamically adjusted by providing a 'settings.yaml' file if the function
      utilizes a 'settings_file_path' to load these settings, offering greater control and customization of the operations.

        The target PAN-OS version to which the Panorama should be upgraded (e.g., '10.1.0').
    dry_run : bool
        If True, performs a simulation of the upgrade process without applying any changes; if False, executes the actual upgrade.

    Raises
    ------
    SystemExit
        Terminates the script if the upgrade process encounters an unrecoverable error at any stage.

    Examples
    --------
    Performing an actual upgrade on a Panorama:

        >>> upgrade_panorama(panorama_instance, '10.1.0', dry_run=True)
        # Simulates the upgrade process to PAN-OS version 10.1.0 without making any system changes.

    Notes
    -----
    - A dry run is advisable before executing the actual upgrade to confirm process steps and readiness.
    - The function ensures comprehensive logging throughout the upgrade process for auditability and troubleshooting.

    test_info: dict,
) -> None:
    """
    Analyzes and logs the outcomes of readiness checks for a firewall or Panorama device, emphasizing failures that
    could impact the upgrade process. This function is integral to the pre-upgrade validation phase, ensuring that
    each device meets the necessary criteria before proceeding with an upgrade. It logs detailed results for each
    readiness check, using severity levels appropriate to the outcome of each test. Critical failures, identified by
    the 'exit_on_failure' flag in the test metadata, will cause the script to terminate, preventing potentially
    hazardous upgrade attempts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    result : dict
        The results of the readiness checks, structured as a dictionary where each key represents a test name and its
        value is a dictionary detailing the test's outcome ('state') and an explanation ('reason').
    hostname : str
        The hostname or IP address of the device being tested, utilized for logging context.
    test_name : str
        The identifier for the specific readiness check being logged, which should match a key in the 'result' dictionary.
    test_info : dict
        A dictionary containing metadata about the readiness check, including a descriptive label ('description'), the
        severity level for logging ('log_level'), and a flag indicating whether failure of this test should halt script
        execution ('exit_on_failure').

    Raises
    ------
    SystemExit
        If a test marked as critical (where 'exit_on_failure' is True) fails, the script will exit to avert an unsafe upgrade.

    Examples
    --------
    Handling a failed readiness check that is critical for upgrade:
        >>> result = {'connectivity_check': {'state': False, 'reason': 'Network unreachable'}}
        >>> test_info = {'description': 'Connectivity Check', 'log_level': 'error', 'exit_on_failure': True}
        >>> check_readiness_and_log(result, 'firewall01', 'connectivity_check', test_info)
        # This logs an error for the failed connectivity check and exits the script to prevent proceeding with the upgrade.

    Notes
    -----
    - This function is pivotal in ensuring that devices are fully prepared for an upgrade by rigorously logging the
      outcomes of various readiness checks.
    - The structured approach to logging facilitates easy identification and troubleshooting of potential issues prior
      to initiating the upgrade process.

    Sets up the logging infrastructure for the application, specifying the minimum severity level of messages to log,
    character encoding for log files, and file logging details such as path and maximum size. The function initializes
    logging to both the console and a rotating file, ensuring that log messages are both displayed in real-time and
    archived for future analysis. The rotating file handler helps manage disk space by limiting the log file size and
    archiving older logs. This setup is crucial for monitoring application behavior, troubleshooting issues, and
    maintaining an audit trail of operations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    level : str
        The minimum severity level of log messages to record. Valid levels are 'DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR',
        and 'CRITICAL', in order of increasing severity.
    encoding : str, optional
        The character encoding for the log files. Defaults to 'utf-8', accommodating a wide range of characters and symbols.
    log_file_path : str, optional
        The path to the log file where messages will be stored. Defaults to 'logs/upgrade.log'.
    log_max_size : int, optional
        The maximum size of the log file in bytes before it is rotated. Defaults to 10 MB (10 * 1024 * 1024 bytes).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the specified logging level is invalid, ensuring that log messages are captured at appropriate severity levels.

    Examples
    --------
    Basic logging configuration with default settings:
        >>> configure_logging('INFO')
        # Configures logging to capture messages of level INFO and above, using default encoding and file settings.

    Advanced logging configuration with custom settings:
        >>> configure_logging('DEBUG', 'iso-8859-1', '/var/log/myapp.log', 5 * 1024 * 1024)
        # Configures logging to capture all messages including debug, using ISO-8859-1 encoding, storing logs in
        # '/var/log/myapp.log', with a maximum file size of 5 MB before rotating.

    Notes
    -----
    - It is essential to configure logging appropriately to capture sufficient detail for effective monitoring and
      troubleshooting, without overwhelming the system with excessive log data.
    - The logging setup, including file path and maximum size, can be customized via a 'settings.yaml' file if the
      application supports loading configuration settings from such a file. This allows for dynamic adjustment of
      logging behavior based on operational needs or user preferences.

def ensure_directory_exists(file_path: str) -> None:
    """
    Ensures the existence of the directory path for a given file path, creating it if necessary.

    This function is crucial for file operations, particularly when writing to files, as it guarantees that the directory path exists prior to file creation or modification. It parses the provided file path to isolate the directory path and, if this directory does not exist, it creates it along with any required intermediate directories. This proactive approach prevents errors related to non-existent directories during file operations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file_path : str
        The complete file path for which the existence of the directory structure is to be ensured. The function identifies the directory path component of this file path and focuses on verifying and potentially creating it.

    Raises
    ------
    OSError
        In the event of a failure to create the directory due to insufficient permissions or other filesystem-related errors, an OSError is raised detailing the issue encountered.

    Examples
    --------
    Creating a directory structure for a log file:
        >>> ensure_directory_exists('/var/log/my_application/error.log')
        # This will check and create '/var/log/my_application/' if it does not already exist, ensuring a valid path for 'error.log'.

    Notes
    -----
    - Employs `os.makedirs` with `exist_ok=True`, which allows the directory to be created without raising an exception if it already exists, ensuring idempotency.
    - Designed to be platform-independent, thereby functioning consistently across various operating systems and Python environments, enhancing the function's utility across diverse application scenarios.

    """
    Identifies and returns a list of versions from the available options that are most similar to a target version.

    This function assesses the similarity between a target version and a list of available versions based on their numerical and structural proximity. It employs a heuristic to quantify the difference between versions, taking into account major, minor, and maintenance version numbers, as well as any hotfix identifiers. The function is useful in scenarios where an exact version match is not found, and the closest alternatives need to be considered, such as software upgrades or compatibility checks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    available_versions : List[str]
        A list of version strings available for comparison, each in the format 'major.minor.maintenance' or 'major.minor.maintenance-hotfix'.
    target_version : str
        The version string that serves as the benchmark for finding close matches, following the same format as the available versions.
    max_results : int, optional
        The maximum number of close match results to return. Defaults to 5.

    Returns
    -------
    List[str]
        A list of the closest version strings to the target version, limited by max_results. The versions are sorted by their similarity to the target version, with the most similar version first.

    Examples
    --------
    Finding close matches to a specific version:
        >>> available_versions = ['10.0.0', '10.1.0', '10.1.1', '9.1.0', '10.1.1-hotfix']
        >>> target_version = '10.1.0'
        >>> find_close_matches(available_versions, target_version)
        ['10.1.0', '10.1.1', '10.1.1-hotfix', '10.0.0', '9.1.0']

    Notes
    -----
    - The function does not guarantee an exact match but provides the best alternatives based on the available options.
    - The similarity heuristic is primarily based on numerical closeness, with structural elements like hotfix identifiers considered as secondary criteria.
    - This function can be particularly useful in automated processes where decision-making relies on selecting the most appropriate version from a set of available options.

def flatten_xml_to_dict(element: ET.Element) -> dict:
    """
    Converts an XML ElementTree element into a nested dictionary, maintaining its hierarchical structure.

    This function iterates over the provided XML ElementTree element, converting each element and its children into a nested dictionary format. Element tags serve as dictionary keys, and the element text content, if present, is assigned as the value. For elements with child elements, a new nested dictionary is created to represent the hierarchy. When an element tag is repeated within the same level, these elements are aggregated into a list under a single dictionary key, preserving the structure and multiplicity of the XML data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    element : ET.Element
        The root or any sub-element of an XML tree that is to be converted into a dictionary.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary representation of the input XML element, where each key corresponds to an element tag, and each value is either the text content of the element, a nested dictionary (for child elements), or a list of dictionaries (for repeated child elements).

    Examples
    --------
    Converting a simple XML element:
        >>> xml_string = '<status>active</status>'
        >>> element = ET.fromstring(xml_string)
        >>> flatten_xml_to_dict(element)
        {'status': 'active'}

    Converting an XML element with nested children:

        >>> element = ET.fromstring(xml_string)
        >>> flatten_xml_to_dict(element)
        {'configuration': {'item': [{'key': '1', '_text': 'Value1'}, {'key': '2', '_text': 'Value2'}]}}

    Notes
    -----
    - This function is designed to work with XML structures that are naturally representable as a nested dictionary. It may not be suitable for XML with complex attributes or mixed content.
    - Attributes of XML elements are converted into dictionary keys with a leading underscore ('_') to differentiate them from child elements.
    - If the XML structure includes elements with repeated tags at the same level, these are stored in a list under the same key to preserve the structure within the dictionary format.
    - The function simplifies XML data handling by converting it into a more accessible and manipulable Python dictionary format.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the XML structure includes elements that cannot be directly mapped to a dictionary format without ambiguity or loss of information, a ValueError is raised to indicate potential data integrity issues.

    Initializes the environment for interacting with a Palo Alto Networks device, including directory setup, logging configuration, and establishing a device connection.

    This function consolidates essential preparatory steps required before performing operations on a Palo Alto Networks device. It ensures the creation of necessary directories for organized data storage and logs, sets up logging with a configurable verbosity level, and establishes a secure connection to the device using the provided API credentials. The function is designed to return a `PanDevice` object, which could be a `Firewall` or `Panorama` instance, ready for subsequent API interactions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hostname : str
        The network address or DNS name of the Palo Alto Networks device to connect to.
    username : str
        The API username for authenticating with the device.
    password : str
        The API password for authenticating with the device.

    Returns
    -------
    PanDevice
        A connected `PanDevice` instance, representing the target Palo Alto Networks device, fully initialized and ready for further API operations.

    Example
    -------
    Initializing the environment for a device:
        >>> device = common_setup('10.0.0.1', 'apiuser', 'apipassword')
        # Ensures necessary directories exist, logging is configured, and returns a connected `PanDevice` instance.

    Notes
    -----
    - Directory setup is performed only once; existing directories are not modified.
    - Logging configuration affects the entire application's logging behavior; the log level can be overridden by `settings.yaml` if `settings_file_path` is detected in the function.
    - A successful device connection is critical for the function to return; otherwise, it may raise exceptions based on connection issues.

    The ability to override default settings with `settings.yaml` is supported for the log level configuration in this function if `settings_file_path` is utilized within `configure_logging`.

    Launches the upgrade process for a Palo Alto Networks firewall, facilitating a comprehensive and controlled upgrade workflow.

    This command orchestrates the steps required for upgrading a firewall appliance, encompassing initial validations, environment setup, and execution of the upgrade process. It is capable of operating in a 'dry run' mode, which simulates the upgrade process without applying any changes, allowing for validation of upgrade prerequisites and assessment of potential issues. The command leverages a series of internal functions to prepare the environment, verify connectivity, ensure compatibility with the target version, and, if all checks pass, proceed with the upgrade.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hostname : str
        The IP address or DNS hostname of the firewall to be upgraded. Must be accessible from the execution environment.
    username : str
        The administrative username for the firewall, used for API or CLI authentication.
    password : str
        The corresponding password for the provided administrative username.
    target_version : str
        The version of PAN-OS to which the firewall is to be upgraded. Must be a valid and supported version for the device.
    dry_run : bool, optional
        When set to True, the function performs all preparatory and validation steps without executing the actual upgrade, defaulting to False.

    Examples
    --------
    Executing an upgrade to version 9.1.0:
        $ python upgrade.py firewall --hostname 192.168.1.1 --username admin --password secure123 --version 9.1.0

        $ python upgrade.py firewall --hostname 192.168.1.1 --username admin --password secure123 --version 9.1.0 --dry-run

    Notes
    -----
    - Prior to executing the upgrade, ensure that the firewall is in a stable state and that there is a reliable network connection to the device.
    - The 'dry run' mode is highly recommended for a preliminary assessment to identify any potential issues that might impede the upgrade process.
    - Default settings for the upgrade process, such as log levels and file paths, can be overridden by providing a `settings.yaml` file, if supported by the implementation of `common_setup` and other called functions within this command.

    Orchestrates a batch upgrade process for firewalls under Panorama's management. This command leverages Panorama
    to coordinate upgrades across multiple devices, streamlining the process. The user has the option to perform a
    dry run to validate the upgrade steps without applying changes, and to specify the target PAN-OS version for the
    upgrade.

    The process begins by establishing a secure connection to Panorama using provided credentials. Firewalls managed
    by Panorama are then enumerated, and a subset may be selected for upgrade based on criteria defined in an
    'inventory.yaml' file or interactively during execution. The 'inventory.yaml' file, if present, pre-selects
    devices for upgrade, bypassing manual selection.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hostname : str
        The hostname or IP address of the Panorama appliance to connect to.
    username : str
        The username for authenticating with Panorama.
    password : str
        The password for the provided username, used for authentication.
    target_version : str
        The version of PAN-OS to which the firewalls should be upgraded.
    dry_run : bool, optional
        If set, the command simulates the upgrade process without making any changes to the devices. Defaults to True, meaning dry run is enabled by default.

    Examples
    --------
    Initiating a batch upgrade process with specified parameters:
        $ python upgrade.py batch --hostname 192.168.1.1 --username admin --password secret --version 10.2.7-h3 --dry-run

    Notes
    -----
    - The command streamlines firewall upgrades by automating repetitive tasks and consolidating operations through Panorama.
    - The dry run feature is useful for validating the upgrade plan and ensuring readiness without impacting production systems.
    - The presence of an 'inventory.yaml' file can automate device selection, facilitating integration into larger automated workflows.
    - It's recommended to back up device configurations and have a rollback plan in place before proceeding with actual upgrades.
    - Customization options, such as setting logging preferences, can be specified through a 'settings.yaml' file if the script supports reading from such a file, allowing for more granular control over the upgrade process.

    Interactively generates an inventory file listing devices managed by a Panorama appliance,
    allowing the user to select which devices to include for potential upgrade. The inventory
    process involves connecting to Panorama, retrieving a list of managed firewalls, and presenting
    the user with a table of devices. The user can then select specific devices to include in the
    inventory file. This file serves as input for subsequent upgrade operations, ensuring that
    upgrades are targeted and organized.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hostname : str
        The hostname or IP address of the Panorama appliance. This is the address used to establish
        a connection for querying managed devices.
    username : str
        The username for authentication with the Panorama appliance. It is required to have sufficient
        permissions to retrieve device information.
    password : str
        The password associated with the username for authentication purposes. Input is hidden to protect
        sensitive information.

    Raises
    ------
    typer.Exit
        Exits the script if the command is invoked for an individual firewall rather than a Panorama appliance,
        as this functionality is specific to Panorama-managed environments.

    Examples
    --------
    Generating an inventory file from the command line:
        >>> typer run inventory --hostname 192.168.1.1 --username admin --password admin
        # This command initiates the inventory process, connecting to the Panorama at 192.168.1.1, and
        # interactively allows the user to select devices to include in the inventory file.

    Notes
    -----
    - The inventory process is an interactive session that requires the user to select devices from a
      presented table. The selections are then saved to 'inventory.yaml'.
    - This function is part of a Typer application that includes multiple subcommands for managing device
      upgrades. It is designed to be used in the context of a larger upgrade workflow.
    - The inventory file generated by this function can be customized or extended by editing 'inventory.yaml'
      directly, allowing for manual inclusion or exclusion of devices as needed.

# Subcommand for creating a settings.yaml file to override default settings

def settings():
    """
    Generates a settings.yaml file allowing customization of script configurations.

    This interactive command guides the user through a series of prompts to configure various aspects of the script's behavior, including concurrency, logging, reboot strategies, readiness checks, snapshots, and timeout settings. Each configuration section allows the user to specify preferences, such as the number of concurrent threads, logging levels, and file paths, among others. Customization of readiness checks and snapshots is also offered, enabling selective execution based on user requirements. The resulting configurations are saved to a 'settings.yaml' file in the current working directory, which the script can subsequently use to override default settings.

    Configuration Sections
    ----------------------
    - Concurrency: Defines the number of concurrent operations, particularly useful for batch operations.
    - Logging: Sets logging preferences including verbosity level, file path, maximum size, and log retention count.
    - Reboot: Configures retry intervals and maximum attempts for device reboots during the upgrade process.
    - Readiness Checks: Allows customization of pre-upgrade readiness checks to run.
    - Snapshots: Enables configuration of pre and post-upgrade snapshots for comparison and rollback purposes.
    - Timeout Settings: Determines timeout values for device connections and command executions.

    Notes
    -----
    - This command is part of the setup process and is intended to be run prior to executing upgrade commands.
    - The 'settings.yaml' file created by this command can be edited manually for further customization.
    - Default values are provided for each configuration option, with the option to accept the default or provide a custom value.
