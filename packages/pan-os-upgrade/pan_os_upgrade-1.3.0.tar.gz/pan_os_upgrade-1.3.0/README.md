<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a comprehensive Python-based solution for automating PAN-OS upgrades. It's designed to provide network administrators and security professionals with an efficient tool to manage upgrades, configurations, and system checks of Palo Alto Networks appliances.

Project Link: [https://github.com/cdot65/pan-os-upgrade](https://github.com/cdot65/pan-os-upgrade)
Documentation: [https://cdot65.github.io/pan-os-upgrade/](https://cdot65.github.io/pan-os-upgrade/)

<!-- SUPPORT -->
## Support

For details on the support provided by Palo Alto Networks for this project, please consult the [SUPPORT.md](https://github.com/cdot65/pan-os-upgrade/blob/main/SUPPORT.md) file in the repository.

### Key Features

- **Three Unique Upgrade Workflows Supported**:
  - `firewall`: targets and upgrades an individual firewall
  - `panorama`: targets and upgrades an individual Panorama appliance
  - `batch`: targets a Panorama appliance and upgrades firewalls in batch
- **Automation of Routine Tasks**: Reduces manual errors and saves time by automating upgrades, configurations, and system checks.
- **Support for Direct and Proxy Connections**: Connect directly to firewalls or through a Panorama appliance, with support for targeting specific devices using filters.
- **Pre/Post Diff**: Network snapshots are taken before and after the upgrade process, providing a PDF report of changes within the network environment after the upgrade completes.
- **Active/Passive High Availability (HA) Workflow**: Fully supports upgrading devices in active/passive HA configurations, ensuring both members are properly upgraded and synchronized.
- **Multi-threading for Efficiency**: Utilizes multi-threading to parallelize upgrades, especially beneficial when upgrading multiple devices through Panorama, enhancing performance and reducing overall upgrade time.
- **Customizable and Extensible**: Execution of the script can be tailored to fit diverse network environments and requirements, offering flexibility for various deployment scenarios.
- **Comprehensive PAN-OS Interactions**: Facilitates extensive interactions with Palo Alto Networks appliances for operations like readiness checks, state snapshots, and report generation.

> **Note**: While this script is optimized for standalone and active/passive HA environments, it has not been tested against active/active or clustered firewalls.

Example Execution

<div class="termy">

```console
pan-os-upgrade batch
Panorama hostname or IP: panorama.cdot.io
Panorama username: officehours
Panorama password: 
Firewall target version (ex: 10.1.2): 10.1.3-h2
Dry Run? [Y/n]: n
===========================================================================
Welcome to the PAN-OS upgrade tool

You have selected to perform a batch upgrade of firewalls through Panorama.

No settings.yaml file was found, the script's default values will be used.
Create a settings.yaml file with 'pan-os-upgrade settings' command.

No inventory.yaml file was found, getting firewalls connected to Panorama.
Create an inventory.yaml file with 'pan-os-upgrade inventory' command.
