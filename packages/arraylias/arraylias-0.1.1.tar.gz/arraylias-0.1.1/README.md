**This repo is still in the early stages of development, there will be breaking API changes**

Arraylias is an open-source Python library providing single-dispatching tools centred around the
construction of an aliased module. Aliased modules are built by initially registering "libraries"
consisting of a collection of types, then registering different versions of a given function in the
aliased module for each underlying type library. When using the aliased module, function calls are
automatically dispatched to version of the function for the correct library based on the type of the
first argument.

Arraylias contains default pre-built aliased versions of both
[NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) and [Scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy), with additional
registration of the [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and
[Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow) array libraries. This enables writing
[NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) and [Scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy) like code that
will execute on [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy),
[JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), and [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow) array objects
as if it had been written in the respective native libraries. If necessary, these default aliases
can be further extended to fit the needs of the application.
