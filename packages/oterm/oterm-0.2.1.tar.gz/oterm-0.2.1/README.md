# oterm
the text-based terminal client for [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama).

## Features

* intuitive and simple terminal UI, no need to run servers, frontends, just type `oterm` in your terminal.
* multiple persistent chat sessions, stored together with the context embeddings and template/system prompt customizations in sqlite.
* can use any of the models you have pulled in Ollama, or your own custom models.
* allows for easy customization of the model's template, system prompt and parameters.

## Installation

Using `brew` for MacOS:

```bash
brew tap ggozad/formulas
brew install ggozad/formulas/oterm
```

Using `pip`:

```bash
pip install oterm
```

## Using

In order to use `oterm` you will need to have the Ollama server running. By default it expects to find the Ollama API running on `http://0.0.0.0:11434/api`. If you are running Ollama inside docker or on a different host/port, use the `OLLAMA_HOST` environment variable to customize the host/port. Alternatively you can use `OLLAMA_URL` to specify the full http(s) url. Setting `OTERM_VERIFY_SSL` to `False` will disable SSL verification.

```bash
OLLAMA_URL=http://host:port/api
```

The following keyboard shortcuts are available:

* `ctrl+n` - create a new chat session
* `ctrl+e` - edit the chat session (change template, system prompt or format)
* `ctrl+r` - rename the current chat session
* `ctrl+s` - export the current chat session as markdown
* `ctrl+x` - delete the current chat session
* `ctrl+t` - toggle between dark/light theme
* `ctrl+q` - quit

* `ctrl+l` - switch to multiline input mode
* `ctrl+p` - select an image to include with the next message

While Ollama is inferring the next message, you can press `ESC` to cancel the inference.

### Customizing models

When creating a new chat, you may not only select the model, but also customize the `template` as well as the `system` instruction to pass to the model. Checking the `JSON output` checkbox will cause the model reply in JSON format. Please note that `oterm` will not (yet) pull models for you, use `ollama` to do that. All the models you have pulled or created will be available to `oterm`.

You can also "edit" the chat to change the template, system prompt or format. Note, that the model cannot be changed once the chat has started. In addition whatever "context" the chat had (an embedding of the previous messages) will be kept.

### Chat session storage

All your chat sessions are stored locally in a sqlite database.
You can find the location of the database by running `oterm --db`.
