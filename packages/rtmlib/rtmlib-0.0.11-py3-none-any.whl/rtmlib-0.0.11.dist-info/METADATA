              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# rtmlib

![demo](https://github.com/Tau-J/rtmlib/assets/13503330/b7e8ce8b-3134-43cf-bba6-d81656897289)

rtmlib is a super lightweight library to conduct pose estimation based on [RTMPose](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose/tree/dev-1.x/projects/rtmpose) models **WITHOUT** any dependencies like mmcv, mmpose, mmdet, etc.

Basically, rtmlib only requires these dependencies:

- numpy
- opencv-python
- opencv-contrib-python
- onnxruntime

Optionally, you can use other common backends like opencv, onnxruntime, openvino, tensorrt to accelerate the inference process.

- For openvino users, please add the path `<your python path>\envs\<your env name>\Lib\site-packages\openvino\libs` into your environment path.

## Installation

- install from pypi:

```shell
pip install rtmlib -i https://pypi.org/simple
```

- install from source code:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Tau-J/rtmlib.git
cd rtmlib

pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install -e .

# [optional]
# pip install onnxruntime-gpu
# pip install openvino

```

## Quick Start

Here is a simple demo to show how to use rtmlib to conduct pose estimation on a single image.

```python
import cv2

from rtmlib import Wholebody, draw_skeleton

device = 'cpu'  # cpu, cuda
backend = 'onnxruntime'  # opencv, onnxruntime, openvino
img = cv2.imread('./demo.jpg')

openpose_skeleton = False  # True for openpose-style, False for mmpose-style

wholebody = Wholebody(to_openpose=openpose_skeleton,
                      mode='balanced',  # 'performance', 'lightweight', 'balanced'. Default: 'balanced'
                      backend=backend, device=device)

keypoints, scores = wholebody(img)

# visualize

# if you want to use black background instead of original image,
# img_show = np.zeros(img_show.shape, dtype=np.uint8)

img_show = draw_skeleton(img_show, keypoints, scores, kpt_thr=0.5)


cv2.imshow('img', img_show)
cv2.waitKey()
```

## WebUI

Run `webui.py`:

```shell
# Please make sure you have installed gradio
# pip install gradio

python webui.py
```

![image](https://github.com/Tau-J/rtmlib/assets/13503330/49ef11a1-a1b5-4a20-a2e1-d49f8be6a25d)

  - [RTMDet](/rtmlib/tools/object_detection/rtmdet.py)
  - [RTMPose](/rtmlib/tools/pose_estimation/rtmpose.py)
    - RTMPose for 17 keypoints
    - RTMW for 133 keypoints
    - RTMO for one-stage pose estimation (17 keypoints)
- Visualization
  - [draw_bbox](https://github.com/Tau-J/rtmlib/blob/adc69a850f59ba962d81a88cffd3f48cfc5fd1ae/rtmlib/draw.py#L9)
  - [draw_skeleton](https://github.com/Tau-J/rtmlib/blob/adc69a850f59ba962d81a88cffd3f48cfc5fd1ae/rtmlib/draw.py#L16)

For high-level APIs (`Solution`), you can choose to pass `mode` or `det`+`pose` arguments to specify the detector and pose estimator you want to use.

```Python
# By mode
wholebody = Wholebody(mode='performance',  # 'performance', 'lightweight', 'balanced'. Default: 'balanced'
                      backend=backend,
                      device=device)

# By det and pose
body = Body(det='https://download.openmmlab.com/mmpose/v1/projects/rtmposev1/onnx_sdk/yolox_x_8xb8-300e_humanart-a39d44ed.zip',
            det_input_size=(640, 640),
            pose='https://download.openmmlab.com/mmpose/v1/projects/rtmposev1/onnx_sdk/rtmpose-x_simcc-body7_pt-body7_700e-384x288-71d7b7e9_20230629.zip',
            pose_input_size=(288, 384),
            backend=backend,
            device=device)
```

For low-level APIs (`Model`), you can specify the model you want to use by passing the `onnx_model` argument.

```Python
# By onnx_model (.onnx)
pose_model = RTMPose(onnx_model='/path/to/your_model.onnx',  # download link or local path
                     backend=backend, device=device)

# By onnx_model (.zip)
pose_model = RTMPose(onnx_model='https://download.openmmlab.com/mmpose/v1/projects/rtmposev1/onnx_sdk/rtmpose-m_simcc-body7_pt-body7_420e-256x192-e48f03d0_20230504.zip',  # download link or local path
                     backend=backend, device=device)
```

## Model Zoo

By defaults, rtmlib will automatically download and apply models with the best performance.

More models can be found in [RTMPose Model Zoo](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose/tree/dev-1.x/projects/rtmpose).
