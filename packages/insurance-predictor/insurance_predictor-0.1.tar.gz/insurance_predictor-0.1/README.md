# Insurance Predictor

Welcome to the Insurance Predictor package! This tool leverages a sophisticated machine learning model to accurately predict whether a customer will purchase car insurance. Built using a state-of-the-art XGBoost algorithm, our pre-trained model simplifies the prediction process, allowing businesses and analysts to make informed decisions quickly and efficiently.

## Features

- **Ease of Use**: Simple API for loading the model and making predictions.
- **High Performance**: Leverages a pre-trained XGBoost model for high accuracy.
- **Flexibility**: Accepts input as a pandas DataFrame, making it easy to integrate into existing workflows.

## Installation

The `insurance_predictor` package can be installed directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install insurance_predictor


Quick Start
Here's how to get started with the Insurance Predictor:

python
from insurance_predictor import InsurancePredictor

# Initialize the predictor
predictor = InsurancePredictor('path/to/model.json')

# Assume `input_features` is your DataFrame with the same structure as the training data
predictions = predictor.predict(input_features)

print("Predictions:", predictions)
How It Works
The Insurance Predictor utilizes a pre-trained XGBoost model that has been trained on comprehensive historical insurance data. The model has learned to identify patterns that indicate whether a customer is likely to purchase insurance based on their profile and interaction history.

Input Data Format
Your input data should be a pandas DataFrame with the following columns:

Column1: Description
Column2: Description
...
Ensure that your data matches the structure and preprocessing steps applied to the training data.
