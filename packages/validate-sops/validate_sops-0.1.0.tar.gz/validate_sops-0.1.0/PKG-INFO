# Validate-SOPS

## Overview

`validate-sops` is a Python utility designed by Vladimir Zhukov to validate that specified files are encrypted using [Mozilla SOPS (Secrets OPerationS)](https://github.com/mozilla/sops). It ensures that sensitive files committed to your repository are securely encrypted, preventing accidental exposure of secrets.

## Features

- Validates multiple files for SOPS encryption.
- Easily integrated into pre-commit hooks for automated validation.
- Provides clear error messages for non-compliant files.

## Usage

To use `validate-sops` as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook in your projects, add the following configuration to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
repos:
-  repo: https://github.com/voldy/validate-sops
    rev: 'v0.1.0'  # Use the latest commit SHA or tag
    hooks:
    -   id: validate-sops
        files: '.*\/secrets\/encrypted\.(yaml|yml|json|env)$' # Adjust based on your file(s) location and type(s)
```

## Local Development Setup

The following instructions are intended for contributors and developers working on the `validate-sops` utility itself.
