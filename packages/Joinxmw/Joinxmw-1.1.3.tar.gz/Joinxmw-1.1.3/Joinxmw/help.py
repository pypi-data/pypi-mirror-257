    This is a module connecting to the Chinese programming community Xiaomawang, which can use user IDs to call many content. For example, user fans, works, etc.
 The current methods available are as follows:
 help -- you can view help and introduction
 reviewid -- you can get user information by introducing the parameter ID
 getworks -- as the name implies, you can get the number of works, total number of views, etc.
 Note: Except twine upload --repository-url https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
for help, the above methods need to be outputted by print or other methods!''')
