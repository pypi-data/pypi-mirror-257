## **What is SCAHpy?**

***SCAHpy*** is an open-source Python package that facilitate the analysis and visualization of the ouputs from atmospheric, oceaninc and hydrological component from the Geophysical Institute of Peru Regional Earth System Model Croco-Oasis-WRF (IGP-RESM-COW)

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

## **Why is SCAHpy?**

Atmospheric component of the coupled model generate a large volumes of output data, making the analysis of model data harder. SCAHpy facilitates the manage of this volumes of data, also enables a manage of coordinates and times to local times. 

## **How to use SCAHpy?**

SCAHpy can be used as a standalone package or it can also be run on the HPC-IGP-Cluster, which has the diagnostic simulations of 22 years of runnings centered on Peru Region.
