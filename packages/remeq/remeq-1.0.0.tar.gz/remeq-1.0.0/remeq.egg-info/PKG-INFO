# REMEQ
It is a simple library for creating a message queue based on Redis and its channels

# How can I use it?
First of all import MessageQueue object into your code.
```python
from remeq import MessageQueue
```
and create a new queue
```python
redis_message_queue = MessageQueue(
    queue_name='YOUR_CHANNEL_NAME',
    queue_method='FIFO',
    host='REDIS_HOST',
    port=6379,
    decode_responses=True
)
```
where
* _queue_name_ - is the name of your channel where you want to store messages
* _queue_method_ - is how the message will be added to the channel and how its message will be taken from the channel, FIFO or LIFO
* _host, port, decode_response_ - are standard settings of Redis object 

So, to send a message into the channel use _send_massage_ method
```python
redis_message_queue.send_message("YOUR_MESSAGE_TEXT")
```
And if you want to get the message from the channel, use _get_message_ method
```python
redis_message_queue.get_message()
```
That's all. Good luck :)
