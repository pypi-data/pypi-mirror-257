# axiom

### Simple instance orchestration

axiom is developed to work with AWS and enables extremely fast and simple ec2 instance orchestration. 

The goal of axiom is to separate the logic of orchestration into a purpose built solution, then, a scanning solution such as swarm can be layered on top. 

Following the unix philosophy, do one thing good and do it well. axiom handles spinning up, spinning down, and building custom images effortlessly.
