## Installation

```bash
pip install AIKitchen-API
```

## Getting Started

```python
from AIKitchen_API import Login, Music, Image

# Login
login = Login(email="your_email@example.com", password="your_password")
token = login.token

#Music Generation
music = Music()
input = "Ambient, soft sounding music I can study to"
tracks = music.get_tracks(input, 2, token)

if isinstance(tracks, list):
    music.b64toMP3(tracks, input,)

#Image Generation 
image = Image()

input = 'Silver coin with a smiling cat, words "5 catnips" "handmade"'
images = image.get_image(input, 3, token)

if isinstance(images, list):
    image.b64toImg(images, input)
```
