## Examples of How To Use

Using is_odd method

```python
from is_odd import is_odd

# Check if a number is odd
number = 4
if is_odd(number):
    print(f"{number} is odd.")
else:
    print(f"{number} is not odd.")
```
This simple library allows you to easily check if a number is odd. The is_odd method takes an integer as input and returns `True` if the number is odd, and `False` otherwise.
