    r"""Compute probability of single state conclusive state exclusion.

    The *quantum state exclusion* problem involves a collection of :math:`n` quantum states

    .. math::
        \rho = \{ \rho_0, \ldots, \rho_n \},

    as well as a list of corresponding probabilities

    .. math::
        p = \{ p_0, \ldots, p_n \}.

    Alice chooses :math:`i` with probability :math:`p_i` and creates the state :math:`\rho_i`.

    Bob wants to guess which state he was *not* given from the collection of states. State exclusion implies that
    ability to discard (with certainty) at least one out of the "n" possible quantum states by applying a measurement.

    This function implements the following semidefinite program that provides the optimal probability with which Bob can
    conduct quantum state exclusion.

        .. math::
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{aligned}
                    \text{minimize:} \quad & \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \langle M_i, \rho_i \rangle \\
                    \text{subject to:} \quad & \sum_{i=1}^n M_i = \mathbb{I}_{\mathcal{X}}, \\
                                             & M_0, \ldots, M_n \in \text{Pos}(\mathcal{X}).
                \end{aligned}
            \end{equation}

        .. math::
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{aligned}
                    \text{maximize:} \quad & \text{Tr}(Y)
                    \text{subject to:} \quad & Y \leq M_1, \\
                                             & Y \leq M_2, \\
                                             & \vdots \\
                                             & Y \leq M_n, \\
                                             & Y \text{Herm}(\mathcal{X}).
                \end{aligned}
            \end{equation}


    The conclusive state exclusion SDP is written explicitly in :cite:`Bandyopadhyay_2014_Conclusive`. The problem
    of conclusive state exclusion was also thought about under a different guise in :cite:`Pusey_2012_On`.

    Examples
    ==========

    Consider the following two Bell states

    .. math::
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{aligned}
                u_0 &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |00 \rangle + |11 \rangle \right), \\
                u_1 &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |00 \rangle - |11 \rangle \right).
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation}

    It is not possible to conclusively exclude either of the two states. We can see that the result of the function in
    :code:`toqito` yields a value of :math:`0` as the probability for this to occur.

    >>> from toqito.state_opt import state_exclusion
    >>> from toqito.states import bell
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>>
    >>> vectors = [bell(0), bell(1)]
    >>> probs = [1/2, 1/2]
    >>>
    >>> '%.2f' % state_exclusion(vectors, probs)[0]
    '0.00'

    .. note::
        You do not need to use `'%.2f' %` when you use this function.

        We use this to format our output such that `doctest` compares the calculated output to the
        expected output upto two decimal points only. The accuracy of the solvers can calculate the
        `float` output to a certain amount of precision such that the value deviates after a few digits
        of accuracy.
