# D407 - Ignored because ==== under a section heading is considered as a missing underline.
# pydocstyle considers ----- an underline.

# D212 and D211 specially selected due to following incompatibilities
# warning: `one-blank-line-before-class` (D203) and `no-blank-line-before-class` (D211) are incompatible. Ignoring `one-blank-line-before-class`.
# warning: `multi-line-summary-first-line` (D212) and `multi-line-summary-second-line` (D213) are incompatible. Ignoring `multi-line-summary-second-line`.

# D416 was adding a semicolon after some section headings when ruff's automated --fix was was used
# As this was not added evenly after all section headings, we ignore this. 

# PLR0912 -- Checks for functions or methods with too many branches. The default number is 12. 
# PLR0911 -- Checks for functions or methods with too many return statements. The default number is 6.
# PLR0915 -- Checks for functions or methods with too many statements. The default number is 50. 
# PLR2004 -- Checks if an equality or an inequality is compared to a variable or a num (prefers variable pre)
# PLR0913 Too many arguments in function definition
