*Massive Black-Hole Binary Population Synthesis for Gravitational Wave Calculations ≋●≋●≋*

<img src="docs/media/holodeck_logo.png" width="260" alt="holodeck logo">

This package is aimed at providing a comprehensive framework for MBH binary population synthesis.  The framework includes modules to perform pop synth using a variety of methodologies to get a handle on both statistical and systematic uncertainties.  Currently, binary populations can be synthesis based on: cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (Illustris), semi-analytic/semi-empirical models (SAMs), and observational catalogs of local galaxies and/or quasars.

## Installation

The `holodeck` framework is currently under substantial, active development.  It will not be available on `pypi` (`pip`) or via `conda` install until it has stabilized.  Currently `holodeck` requires `python >= 3.9`, and tests are run on versions `3.9`, `3.10`, `3.11`.

The recommended installation for active development is to:

0) OPTIONAL: create and activate a new anaconda environment to isolate your build: `conda create --name holo310 python=3.10; conda activate holo310`
1) Clone the holodeck repository: `git clone https://github.com/nanograv/holodeck.git`
2) Install the required external packages specified in the requirements file: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  OPTIONAL: install development requirements: `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
3) Build the required c libraries from holodeck cython code: `cd holodeck; python setup.py build_ext -i`
4) Perform an development/editable local installation: `python setup.py develop`

The 'editable' installation allows the code base to be modified, and have those changes take effect when using the `holodeck` module without having to rebuild/reinstall it.

### MPI

For some scripts (particularly for generating libraries), an MPI implementation is required (e.g. `openmpi`), along with the [`mpi4py` package](https://github.com/mpi4py/mpi4py).  This is not included as a requirement in the `requirements.txt` file as it significantly increases the installation complexity, and is not needed for many `holodeck` use cases.  If you need the additional functionality, try installing `mpi4py` and if needed an MPI implementation.

To see if you have `mpi4py` installed, run `python -c 'import mpi4py; print(mpi4py.__version__)'` from a terminal.

#### macos

If you are using homebrew on macos, you should be able to simply run: `brew install mpi4py` which will [include the required openmpi implementation](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#macos).  If you already have an MPI implementation installed, and you are using anaconda, you should be able to install the `mpy4py` python package with: `conda install mpi4py`.


## Quickstart

The best way to get started is using the demonstration/testing notebooks included in the `notebooks/` directory.

## Documentation

The primary sources of documentation for `holodeck` are this `README.md` file, the notebooks included in the `notebooks/` directory, and docstrings included in the source code directly.  [`readthedocs` documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/holodeck-gw) are being written and improved, and a methods paper is in preparation.

## Contributing

This project is being led by the [NANOGrav](http://nanograv.org/) Astrophysics Working Group.

Details on contributions and the mandatory code of conduct can be found in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

To-do items and changes to the API should be included in the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) file.

Contributions are not only welcome but encouraged, anywhere from new modules/customizations to bug-fixes to improved documentation and usage examples.  The git workflow is based around a `main` branch which is intended to be (relatively) stable and operational, and an actively developed `dev` branch.  New development should be performed in "feature" branches (made off of the `dev` branch), and then incorporated via pull-request (back into the `dev` branch).

### Testing

(Unit)tests should be developed in two ways: for basic functions/behaviors, standard unit-tests can be placed in the `holodeck/tests/` directory.  More complex functionality should be tested in notebooks (in `notebooks/`) where they can also be used as demonstrations/tutorials for that behavior.  The python script `scripts/convert_notebook_tests.py` converts target notebooks into python scripts in the `holodeck/tests/` directory, which can then be run by `pytest`.  The script `scripts/holotest.sh` will run the conversion script and then run `pytest`.


### Formatting

New code should generally abide by PEP8 formatting, with [`numpy` style docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).  Exceptions are:

   * lines may be broken at either 100 or 120 columns

### Notebooks

Please strip all notebook outputs before commiting notebook changes.  The [`nbstripout`](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout) package is an excellent option to automatically strip all notebook output only in git commits (i.e. it doesn't change your notebooks in-place).  You can also use `nbconvert` to strip output in place: `jupyter nbconvert --clear-output --inplace <NOTEBOOK-NAME>.ipynb`.

To install this package for just this repository:

   * (1) install:  `pip install --upgrade nbstripout`  or  `conda install -c conda-forge nbstripout`
   * (2) enable: `nbstripout --install --attributes .gitattributes`   (run this in the top-level `holodeck/` directory)
