# PyS(e)im
PyS(e)im is an open source waveform viewer.
It is meant to play together with ngspice and kicad. With just one click you can netlist, simulate and show the simulation results in a window:
![Example](doc/example.png)

Make sure to include something like the following in your ngspice control section:
``` spice
.probe alli
.control
	save all
    tran 100n 1m uic
    run
    write
.endc
```
When running ngspice it should create a `rawspice.raw` file



# How to use?

PyS(e)im is available on pypi:
``` bash
pip install pyseim
pyseim --help
```

# Features

- Netlist, simulate and show results with just one click
- Equation support

# Alpha Status

- Only tested with Mac
- Only transient simulations working currently
- All signals in one plot

It is a very simple script (currently just one file). However, I find it already quite useful.

# Ideas

- Show SOA violations
- Support for AC simulations
- ...

# Contribute

Feel free to contribute.

# Fun Fact
The package name is close to PySim that was already taken. PyS(e)im is a close match. Seim means 'viscous juice'. Therefore, the icon is a honeycomb.
