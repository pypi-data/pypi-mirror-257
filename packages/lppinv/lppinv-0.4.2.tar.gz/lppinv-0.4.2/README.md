# A non-iterated general implementation of the LPLS estimator for cOLS, TM, and custom cases

The program implements the **LPLS** (linear programming through least squares) estimator with the help of the Moore-Penrose inverse (pseudoinverse), calculated using *singular value decomposition (SVD)*, with emphasis on the estimation of OLS constrained in values (**cOLS**), Transaction Matrix (**TM**), and **custom** (user-defined) cases. The pseudoinverse offers a
unique minimum-norm least-squares solution, which is the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE); see Albert (1972, Chapter VI). (Over)determined problems are accompanied by *regression* analysis, which is feasible in their case. For such and especially all remaining cases, a Monte Carlo-based
*ttest* of mean **NRMSE** (normalized by the standard deviation of the RHS) is performed, the sample being drawn from a uniform or user-provided distribution (via a *Python function*).

OLS constrained in values (**cOLS**) is an estimation based on constraints in the model and/or data but not in parameters. Typically, such models are of size ≤ **kN**, where **N** is the number of observations, since the number of their constraints may vary in the LHS (e.g., level, derivatives, etc.).

**Example of a cOLS problem:**  
*Estimate the trend and the cyclical component of a country's GDP given the textbook or any other definition of its peaks, troughs, and saddles. For a pre-LPLS approach to this problem, see (Bolotov, 2014).*

Transaction Matrix (**TM**) of size (**M x N**) is a formal model of interaction (allocation, assignment, etc.) between **M** and **N** elements in any imaginable system, such as intercompany transactions (netting tables), industries within/between economies (input-output tables), cross-border trade/investment (trade/investment matrices), etc., where **row** and **column sums** are known, but **individual elements** of the TM may not be:  

- a netting table is a type of **TM** where **M = N** and the elements are subsidiaries of a MNC;
- an input-output table (IOT) is a type of **TM** where **M = N** and the elements are industries;
- a matrix of trade/investment is a type of **TM** where **M = N** and the elements are countries or (macro)regions, where diagonal elements may be equal to zero;
- a country-product matrix is a type of **TM** where **M ≠ N** and the elements are of different types;  
...

**Example of a TM problem:**  
*Estimate the matrix of trade/investment with/without zero diagonal elements, the country shares in which are unknown. For a pre-LPLS approach to this problem, see (Bolotov, 2015).*

## Methods and formulas:
The LP problem in the **LPLS** estimator is a matrix equation **`a @ x = b`**, loosely based on the structure of the Simplex tableau, where **`a`** consists of coefficients for CONSTRAINTS, LP-type CHARACTERISTIC and/or SPECIFIC, and for SLACK/SURPLUS VARIABLES (the upper part) as well as for the MODEL (the lower part), as illustrated in Figure 1. Each part of **`a`** can be omitted to accommodate a particular case:  

- **cOLS** problems require SPECIFIC CONSTRAINTS, no LP-type CHARACTERISTIC CONSTRAINTS, and a MODEL;  
- **TM** requires LP-type CHARACTERISTIC CONSTRAINTS, no SPECIFIC CONSTRAINTS, and an optional MODEL;  
- SLACK/SURPLUS VARIABLES are included only for inequality constraints and should be set to **1** or **-1**;  
...

The solution to the equation, **`x = pinv(a) @ b`**, is estimated with the help of SVD and is a **minimum-norm least-squares generalized solution** if the rank of **`a`** is not full. To check if **`a`** is within the computational limits, its (maximum) dimensions can be calculated using the formulas:  

- **(k \* N) x (K + K\*)** **cOLS** - without slack/surplus variables;
- **(k \* N) x (K + K\* + l)** **cOLS** - with slack/surplus variables;
- **(M + N) x (M \* N)** **TM** - without slack/surplus variables;
- **(M + N) x (M \* N + l**) **TM** - with slack/surplus variables;
- **M x N**  **custom** - without slack/surplus variables;
- **M x (N + l)** **custom** - with slack/surplus variables;

where, in **cOLS** problems, **K** is the number of independent variables in the model (including the constant), **K\*** is the number of eventual extra variables in CONSTRAINTS, and **N** is the number of observations; in **TM**, **M** and **N** are the dimensions of the matrix; and in **custom** cases, **M** and **N** or **M x (N + l)** are the dimensions of **`a`**.

**Constructing the LHS**  

- `model=np.empty((0,0))` : *array_like*, the MODEL part of **`a`**, including an eventual user-provided constant as a matrix column in **cOLS** (see Methods and formulas)
