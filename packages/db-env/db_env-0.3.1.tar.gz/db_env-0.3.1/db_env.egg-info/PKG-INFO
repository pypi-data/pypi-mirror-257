What can db_env do?
db_env aims to make it easier to create relational database environments within Python. Currently db_env holds the following functions:
- db_create_connect(db_name)
- db_create_table_sql(sql_string)


important Info:
- this library needs sqlite3 in addition. please install before usage.
- db_name needs to be string and have ".db" as ending. E.g.:
    "zoo.db"
- CREATE TABLE statements need to be writen in strings. E.g.:
    "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS CUSTOMERS;CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS(NAME VARCHAR(30),AGE INTEGER, ORDER_ID INTEGER);"
- it is encouraged to import your writen SQL-strings from another py-file as a variable (e.g. ENUM). However, you can directly insert your SQL-statement as a string into the function.


Goal for upcoming versions:
- Functions which give user the option to write his own SQL-statements into an extra Python file and call writen SQL-strings as variables into your working environment.
- Functions to collect and insert data from called API.
- Functions to select data from database and use it for pandas dataframe.
