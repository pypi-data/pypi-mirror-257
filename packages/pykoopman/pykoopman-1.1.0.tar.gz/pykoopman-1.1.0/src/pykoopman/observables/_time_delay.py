class TimeDelay(BaseObservables):
    """
    A class for creating time-delay observables. These observables are formed by
    taking time-lagged measurements of state variables and interpreting them as new
    state variables.

    The two state variables :math:`[x(t), y(t)]` could be supplemented with two
    time-delays each, yielding a new set of observables:

    .. math::
        [x(t), y(t), x(t-\\Delta$ t), y(t-\\Delta t),
        x(t-2\\Delta t), y(t - 2\\Delta t)]

    This example corresponds to taking :code:`delay =` :math:`\\Delta t` and
    :code:`n_delays = 2`.

    Note that when transforming data the first :code:`delay * n_delays` rows/samples
    are dropped as there is insufficient time history to form time-delays for them.
