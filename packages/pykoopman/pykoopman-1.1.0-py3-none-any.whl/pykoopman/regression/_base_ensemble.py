class EnsembleBaseRegressor(TransformedTargetRegressor):
    """
    This class serves as a wrapper for PyKoopman regressors that utilize ensemble or
    non-consecutive training data.

    `EnsembleBaseRegressor` inherits from `TransformedTargetRegressor` and checks
    whether the provided regressor object implements the `fit` and `predict` methods.

    Attributes:
        regressor (sklearn.base.BaseEstimator): A regressor object that implements
            `fit` and `predict` methods.
        func (function): A function to apply to the target `y` before passing it to
            the `fit` method. The function must return a 2-dimensional array.
            If `func` is `None`, the identity function is used.
        inverse_func (function): A function to apply to the prediction of the
            regressor. This function is used to return predictions to the same space
            as the original training labels. It must return a 2-dimensional array.

    Raises:
        AttributeError: If the regressor does not have a callable `fit` or
            `predict` method.
        ValueError: If both `transformer` and functions `func`/`inverse_func`
            are set, or if 'func' is provided while 'inverse_func' is not.

    Note:
        This class does not implement the `fit` method on its own, instead, it checks
        the methods of the provided regressor object and raises an AttributeError if
        the required methods are not present or not callable. It also performs some
        pre-processing on the target values `y` before fitting the regressor, and
        provides additional checks and warnings for the transformer and inverse
        functions.
