```

## Hello World

```bash
$ plus init hello_world
$ cd hello_world
$ plus run
```

## Subprojects

First create a new project to be the parent project.

```bash
$ plus init parent_project
```

Then create a new project to be the child project.
```bash
$ cd parent_project
$ plus init child_project --lib
```

Now you can add the child project to the parent project.
In the parent project directory, open the `project.toml` file and add the child project to the `subprojects` list.

```toml
...
[subprojects]
child_project = { path = "child_project" }
...
```

Now you can build the parent project and the child project will be built too.

```bash
$ plus build
```
