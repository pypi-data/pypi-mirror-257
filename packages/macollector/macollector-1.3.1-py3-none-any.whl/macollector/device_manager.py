"""
device_manager.py: Manages multiple network devices for concurrent processing.

This module contains the DeviceManager class, which is responsible for
managing a collection of network devices. It initializes NetworkDevice
objects and manages their concurrent processing using a thread pool. The
class also collects MAC addresses from the devices and handles errors
that occur during processing.

The DeviceManager class allows for specifying credentials, a list of
device IP addresses, and the maximum number of threads for concurrent
processing.
