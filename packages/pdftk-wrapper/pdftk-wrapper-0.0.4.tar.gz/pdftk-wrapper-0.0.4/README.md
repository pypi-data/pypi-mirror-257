# Welcome to pdftk-wrapper

## Installation

`python3 -m pip install pdftk-wrapper`

Has been tested with `python>=3.8`.

## Usage

This is a Python wrapper over pdftk.  At present it supports only removing
pages from a pdf.  Example of a run:

```
pdftk-remove-pages ./sample_1.pdf 1,3-195 ./gitignore_sample_1.pdf
```

Assuming the file `sample_1.pdf` has 195 pages.  The above would remove the first page and pages 3 up to 195 and output the resulting pdf to `gitignore_sample_1.pdf`So the resulting file `gitignore_sample_1.pdf` would just contain one page which was the second page in `sample_1.pdf`

```
$  pdftk-remove-pages --help
