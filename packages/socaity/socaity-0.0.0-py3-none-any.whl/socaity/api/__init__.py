The references to ClientAPIs and SimpleAPIs

# CLIENT APIs
    A ClientAPI is a class that contains the logic to pre and post_process a request to an endpoint.
    It is a wrapper around the client and job classes.
    Instead of using clients and jobs directly, you can use the predefined "model" ClientAPI classes to do the work.

# SIMPLE APIs
    A SimpleAPI is a wrapper around a ClientAPI.
    It initiates the ClientAPI with the correct endpoint and model name, and provides a simple function to run the job.
