or 

`pip install git+https://github.com/Jako-K/justshowit`

# How to use

# Demo
Note: The demos presented below are all within a Jupyter notebook. However, if `justshowit` is used outside a Jupyter environment, all images will be displayed with cv2 instead.

```python

from justshowit import show 
import cv2
import numpy as np
import torch
import random
from glob import glob

# Example of different input images
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jako-K/justshowit/main/readme_stuff/test_image1.png"
torch_image = torch.ones((3, 200, 300)) * 150
image_bgr = cv2.imread("./readme_stuff/test_image2.jpg")
path1 = "./readme_stuff/test_image2.jpg"
path2 = "./readme_stuff/test_image3.png"
path3 = "./readme_stuff/test_image4.png"
video_path = "./videos/archery.mp4"

```

```python

# Display a single image
show(url, resize_factor=0.5)

```

# Demo - More customizable

Besides `show`, there's 5 other functions that allow for greater customization:
1. `show_collage`: Pack a bunch of images together in an efficent way
2. `show_grid`: Automatically find a suitable grid layout
3. `show_grid_configurable`: Customizable grid layout (row/col/image text, drop-shadow, margin adjustment, ...)
4. `show_video`: Display video frames with some customization (frame count, video details, ...)
5. `play_video`: An interactive video player implemented entirely within cv2

```python

from justshowit import (
    show_collage, show_grid, show_grid_configurable, show_video, play_video
)
some_images = glob("./alot_of_different_images/*")

```


```python

# `show_collage` will try and pack the images within the smallest possible canvas.
# For details about the optimization and packing algorithm see `Implementation details`
# at the bottom of the page.
show_collage(
    image_source = some_images, 
    resize_factor=0.5,
    canvas_domains = ((3000, 2000), (7000, 2000)), # Canvas dimensions to try
    overlap_tolerance = 0.1, # How much each image may overlap with each other
    max_output_image_size_wh = (2000,1500),
    save_image_path="readme_6.png"
)

```

```python

# `show_grid` selects a suitable grid layout based on the shape of the images. 
# Images with similar shapes will be resized and displayed in a grid with uniform spacing, 
# whereas more diverse images will be shown in a layout as demonstrated below
show_grid(
    image_source = some_images[:48], 
    allow_auto_resize = False, # If the function may resize to get a better grid layout
    title = "A nice way to quickly show a lot of images",
)

# Extra functions
The functions demoed above use a lot of helpers functions.<br>
I realized that some of them could be useful on there own. They should be pretty self-explanatory:

1. `draw_image_title`
2. `draw_text_cv2`
3. `draw_text_pillow`
4. `parse_arbitrary_image_source`
5. `parse_image_as_uint8_rgb_numpy_array`
6. `parse_numpy_image_batch_as_uint8_rgb_numpy_array`
7. `parse_torch_image_batch_as_uint8_rgb_numpy_array`
8. `parse_video_to_images`
9. `parse_video_to_images_fixed_count`

# Implementation details 
Finding an effective way to automatically display multiple images turned out to be surprisingly challenging. Through trial and error, I discovered the need to distinguish between two scenarios: (1) when all images have approximately the same shape and aspect ratio, and (2) when some or all images differ in shape and aspect ratio.

## Case 1.
For case (1), a grid layout was used, defined by the number of columns, rows, and image resizing. The layout was automatically chosen based on the minimizationn of three factors: deviation from a desired final aspect ratio (default 1920/1080 pixels), the number of empty cells (e.g., 14 images in a 4x4 grid would have 2 empty cells), and the amount of resizing needed for each image.

## Case 2.
In case (2), a "collage" approach was employed. A set of potential canvases was provided to a packing algorithm, which then attempted to find a visually pleasing layout. Formalizing "visually pleasing" proved challenging and is still a work in progress. An illutstration of the packing algorithm can be seen below (A few details have been left out, but the illustation is mostly complete)
