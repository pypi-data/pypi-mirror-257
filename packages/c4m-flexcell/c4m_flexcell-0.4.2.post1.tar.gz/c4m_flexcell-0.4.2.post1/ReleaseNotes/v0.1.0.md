# v0.1.0 Release Notes

Lot's of changes everywhere in the c4m-flexcell; main highlights compared to v0.0.4:

* Update to changing PDKMaster API
* First implementation of new layout generation code that is not based anymore on lambda rules but the real provided PDKMaster technology design rules. When fully finished this will lead to more flexible scaling of width and height of the cells.
* Add CI support to improve detection of regressions in the code base.
