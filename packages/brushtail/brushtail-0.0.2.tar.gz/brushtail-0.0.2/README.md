# Brushtail 

A simple way to structure web scraping; using chained functions to express dense workflow simply.

In development, with a short roadmap to version 1. 


## Background
I find some of the structure of webscraping a little tedious; it can require many repetetive steps, and scripts often need to change as websites change. 

Thus, a solution which can chain steps together, with a goal of creating more easily disposible (or fixable) scraping scripts. 

The drawback of chaining things in this fashion is that by connecting many failure points, the overall script may fail easily; but that isn't an issue for my use cases.


## Roadmap
- Clearer comments and typing
- Code examples
