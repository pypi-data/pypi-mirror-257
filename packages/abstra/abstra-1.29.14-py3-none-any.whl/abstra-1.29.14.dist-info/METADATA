- serveless endpoints
- script schedulers
- zero-config authentication
- one-click scalable deploy
- cloud managed database
- plug'n play api integrations
- automatic audit logging
- access control

and much more! ⚡️

## 🚦 Getting started

[![](./images/getting-started.png)](https://youtu.be/kkTRU8PS8cg)

This package is compatible with Python >= 3.8

To install, run the following:

```
pip install abstra
```

Run the CLI server in the directory where you'd like to create your Abstra project. This can be any folder:

```
abstra serve ./your-project-directory
```

## 🧩 Workflow builder for Python

Workflows is perfect for automating repetitive processes that require a mix of manual steps and integration between systems.

Visually assemble a process made up of Python-coded steps. All steps share an environment, variables and functions.

## 📝 Scriptable forms

Forms is the quickest way to build interactive user interfaces on the web. Use it to get user input during your Workflow's run, such a request approval or additional data.

Manipulate this input with Python and any desired lib before moving to the next step.
