# Anneal

This is a `python` package for simulated annealing (and quenching) in all its
many guises. The design decisions are described in the corresponding [ArXiV preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02811v2).

## Development

`pdm` is used throughout.

``` sh
micromamba create -f environment.yml
micromamba activate anneal-dev
```
