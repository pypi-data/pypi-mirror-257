[Templateless](https://templateless.com) lets you generate and send transactional emails quickly and easily so you can focus on building your product.

## ✨ Features

- 👋 **Anti drag-and-drop by design** — emails are a part of your code
- ✅ **Components as code** — function calls turn into email HTML components
- 💻 **SDK for any language** — use your favorite [programming language](https://github.com/orgs/templateless/repositories)
- 🔍 **Meticulously tested** — let us worry about email client compatibility
- 💌 **Use your favorite ESP** — Amazon SES, SendGrid, Mailgun + more
- 💪 **Email infrastructure** — rate-limiting, retries, scheduling + more
- ⚡ **Batch sending** — send 1 email or 1,000 with one API call

## 🚀 Getting started

Install the package from PyPI, e. g. with pip:

```bash
pip install templateless
```

Import the `Templateless` class from the `templateless` package:

```python
from templateless import Templateless
templateless = Templateless()
```

## 👩‍💻 Quick example

This is all it takes to send a signup confirmation email:

```python
from templateless import Content, Email, EmailAddress, Templateless


def main():
    content = (
        Content()
        .text("Hi, please **confirm your email**:")
        .button("Confirm Email', 'https://your-company.com/signup/confirm?token=XYZ")
        .build()
    )

    email = (
        Email()
        .to(EmailAddress("<YOUR_CUSTOMERS_EMAIL_ADDRESS>"))
        .subject("Confirm your signup 👋")
        .content(content)
        .build()
    )

    templateless = Templateless("<YOUR_API_KEY>")
    result = templateless.send(email)

    print(result)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
