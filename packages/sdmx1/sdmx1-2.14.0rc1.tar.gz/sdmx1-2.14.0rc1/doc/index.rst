Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange (SDMX) in Python
*******************************************************

:mod:`sdmx` is a `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ package that implements `SDMX <http://www.sdmx.org>`_  2.1 (`ISO 17369:2013 <https://www.iso.org/standard/52500.html>`_) and 3.0, which are standards and formats for exchange of **statistical data and metadata** that are developed and used by national statistical agencies, central banks, and international organisations.

:mod:`sdmx` can be used to:

- explore the data available from :doc:`data providers <sources>` such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Eurostat, OECD, and United Nations;
- read and write data and metadata in SDMX formats including SDMX-ML (XML) and SDMX-JSON, either:

  - from local files, or
  - retrieved from SDMX web services, with query validation and caching;

- convert data and metadata into `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`_ objects, for use with the analysis, plotting, and other tools in the Python data science ecosystem;
- apply the :doc:`SDMX Information Model <implementation>` to your own data;

…and much more.

Get started
===========

The SDMX standards are designed to be flexible enough to accommodate almost *any* data.
To do this, they include a large number of abstract concepts for describing data, metadata, and their relationships.
These are collectively called the SDMX **Information Model** (**IM**).

.. _not-the-standard:

This documentation does not repeat full descriptions of SDMX, the IM, or SDMX web services; it focuses on the Python implementation in :mod:`sdmx` itself.
Detailed knowledge of the IM is not needed to use :mod:`sdmx`; see a :doc:`usage example in only 10 lines of code <example>` or a longer, narrative :doc:`walkthrough <walkthrough>`.

To learn about SDMX in more detail, use the :doc:`list of resources and references <resources>`, or read the :doc:`API documentation <api>` and :doc:`implementation notes <implementation>` for the :mod:`sdmx.model` and :mod:`sdmx.message` modules that fully implement the IM in Python.
